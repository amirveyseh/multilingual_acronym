       First, I would like to express my deepest appreciation to my supervisor,
Professor Sử Đình Thành, for his lectures as well as coaching me while I performed
this research. Without his instructions and persistent support, this dissertation would
not have been possible.
       Second, I would like to thank all UEH’s lecturers who instructed me in my
research methods courses during my time as a Ph. D. student in the University of
Economics, Ho Chi Minh City. Dr. Trần Thị Tuấn Anh’s expert guidance was
especially valuable for completing my research with clear and logical
interpretations of the methodology.
       Third, I am also grateful to my parents, my young sisters, and my sons for
their encouragement in my life. I also wish to express my endless thanks to my love
for his sacrifice and daily care of me.

Abstract:

        This study runs a co-integration and Granger causality tests that corroborate
the existence of long-run co-integration linkages of public finance and economic
growth and a bi-directional causal correlation between tax revenue and government
expenditure. This finding suggests that to control deficits, a government’s decisions
on collecting taxes and government expenditure should be simultaneous. To verify
the effects of governance represented by control of corruption on modifying the
relationship between public finance and economic growth, this study applies a
seemingly unrelated regressions model for the dataset, followed by a robustness
check using a corruption perception index developed by the Transparency
International organization. Measuring public finance by two factors: total tax
revenue and general government expenditure helps this study to confirm the results,
which reveal that the governance has a positive role in the economy. Additionally,
the interaction between governance and tax revenue or government expenditure
affects economy diversely depending on the different economic groups of
developing and developed countries1. For instance, in developing countries, the
interaction between public finance and governance always becomes a beneficial
factor for growth. While in developed countries, this interaction does not have any
meaning with taxation. Therefore, it may increase the efficiency of government
expenditure only. On the first side, the findings also suggest that developing
countries should focus on governance in anti-corruption to increase the
effectiveness of public finance and promote their economic growth. On the other
hand, developed countries should make the decision on public finance separately
with control of corruption.

 In this study we call the “developed countries” are high-income countries, which were classified by World
bank and determined as those with a GNI per capita, computed using the World Bank Atlas method. On 1
July 2015, high-income countries gained more than $12,736. This study also calls the “developing countries”
are those countries were classified by World bank as seen as below. Low-income economies are determined
as those with a GNI per capita of $1,045 or less in 2014; Lower-middle-income economies are those with a
GNI per capita of more than $1,045 but less than $4, 125; and upper-middle-income economies are more
than $4,125 but less than $12,736.

1.1.   Research background

1.1.1. An overview of the status of global economies in the period 1996–
2016

       During this period, the global economy witnessed the financial crisis
that arose when the real estate bubble exploded in the US in 2007, driving the
US financial crisis and influencing production and exports in numerous
developing countries. However, the World Bank’s report said that in 2016, the
economy’s growth recovery has rebounded (see table 1.1).

      From figure 1.1, we can see that there is a difference in income per
capita between 1996 and 2016 in developed countries. The maximum income
per capita is more than 13.8 times the minimum in 1996. By 2016, this gap has
declined to only 6.5 times. In 1996, Norway had the highest income per capita
at more than 73,626.16 US dollars. In contrast, Latvia had the lowest at almost
5,321.397 US dollars. In 2016, Norway still had the highest GDP per capita,
which was about 90,344.41 US dollars. However, the Seychelles had the
lowest income per capita (only 13,963.59 US dollars of GDP per capita).
Additionally, most developed countries collected more tax and spent less. In
1996, Norway’s tax revenue as a proportion of GDP was nearly 53.5 percent,
while its expenditure was only 47.5 percent. An interesting point is that
Latvia, with the lowest income per capita, also collected less tax (36.38%) and
spent more (37.03%). Norway continued to maintain its tax revenue
proportion at more than 53 percent of GDP in 2016.

       There is a large gap (152.43 times) between the highest and lowest
GDP per capita in developing countries in 1996. At about 30,333.74 US
dollars, Islamic Republic of Iran had the highest income per capita, while
Ethiopia remained at the bottom with only about 199.005 US Dollars. Islamic
Republic of Iran collected tax revenue of 20.165 percent of GDP and spent
more than 21.08 percent of GDP. In contrast, Ethiopia collected only 14.86
percent of GDP in tax revenue and spent 18.79 percent of GDP. In 2016, the
gap between the highest and lowest GDP per capita in developing countries is
lower than in 1996 at about 26.68 times. Russia remained at the top with about
11,099.17 US dollars per capita, while Madagascar had only 416.0027 US
dollars per capita. Russia increased their tax revenue proportion more than
1.02 percent compared with 1996, however this country spent lower than 1996
(see figure 1.2).

1.1.2. The differences of public finance and growth between developed
and developing countries

a)    Growth rate and stability in economies

      Figure 1.3 indicates that developed countries maintain stability in their
economies better than developing countries.

                      Source: World Bank group (2017)

b)    Tax revenue, government expenditure, and control of corruption

       Tax revenue is an important component of revenue for most
governments. While most developing countries collected less in taxes than
developed countries, they spent more, and their economies grew more rapidly
from 1996 to 2016 (see figure 1.5 ).

         Through figure 1.5, we can observe that the rapid economic growth
trend in developing economies is the same as that of the whole sample.

 GDP per capita is gross domestic product divided by midyear population. The World Bank
considered that GDP is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus
any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. This calculation
of GDP is without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and
degradation of natural resources. Data are in constant 2010 U.S. dollars.

However, beginning in 2010 these countries have attempted to spend more and
collect fewer taxes for rapid growth

per capita for 38 developed cuntries in 1996-2016.

      In contrast, developed countries prefer to collect more taxes and spend
less to maintain a slow rate of growth in their economies (see figure 1.6). The
World Bank’s report shows that a large gap exists between developed and
developing countries in economic growth, as well as tax revenue. What is the
cause of the differences between two these groups of countries? Policy makers
around the world have been challenged in dealing with this question. In
summary, the global economy from 1996 to 2016 varies from year to year.
There is a large gap in income per capita between developed countries and
developing countries. There is also a large gap in the ratio of contribution to
global GDP growth. As mentioned by Spence (2011), the global monitoring
report 2015/2016 confirms that high-income countries contributed 60% to
global GDP growth in 2014, but their population was less than 15%.
Moreover, the World Bank estimated that income per capita in this period
might have increased more than it will in future periods. There are also large
differences between poor and rich countries in tax revenue, effectiveness of
government expenditure, and corruption, in this period. The maximum of real
                                            8



GDP per capita can be bigger than the minimum by 490 times. The largest gap
between the highest rate of tax revenue or expenditure and its lowest is 7
times. The highest indicator of control of corruption is 2.47, while the lowest
is only -1.53 (see table 4.1).

        Through figure 1.7, we find that in 2016, with exception of Greece,
which maintained a negative index of control of corruption, most other
developed countries had a positive index of control of corruption. However,
figure 1.8 indicates that most developing countries showed a negative index of
                                      10



control of corruption, and a lower index of human development of around 0.26
to 0.7. In 1996, the developing country with the highest index of human
development is Bulgaria, and the lowest was Mali. This index improved; in
2016, the highest index is 0.8 and belongs to Russia, while Mali remained the
lowest (0.44). Georgia is a country that improved its corruption status too
rapidly. In 1996, this country had the lowest indicator of control of corruption
(-1.53), and Namibia had the highest score of about 0.81. In 2016, Georgia
became the country with the highest score of control of corruption (0.67),
while Cambodia was at the bottom with a -1.3 score of control of corruption.
The real situation of global economies requires us to answer the question:
How does public finance correlate with countries’ income? Does governance
affect this linkage?

1.2.   Research motivation

       First, public finance is a key source of government budget and its
effects are complicated. Holley (2011) argued that any change in public policy
could affect economic activities. However, until now a little research
examined the relationship between economic growth and public finance,
which measure by total tax revenue and general expenditure. Nevertheless,
government expenditure is a major source of public goods. Lump-sum taxes
for each person should guide government expenditure. In contrast, Barro’s
(1990) argument is too simple, because his assumption relates only to income
taxes. Tax revenue and government expenditure can demonstrate the full
effectiveness of government quality and capability. For instance, the
government can use the value from collecting taxes to develop labor force, to
supply the appropriate infrastructure, or to invest the new technologies.
Additionally, the labor force, infrastructure, and new technologies are key
sources, which promote the production and ensure the safety society.
Furthermore, any taxes change can drive the investors and households to make
                                      11



a different decision (Aghion and Howitt, 2009). The total tax revenue includes
sale tax, income tax, export-import tax, capital and environment taxes, etc. In
case if government increase or reduce any tax rate or expand the tax base, so
investor or households could change their behavior in investment or
consumption. As we may know that, these activities can affect the capital
stock, which is a major factor of the economic growth model. However, the
almost previous study argued the role of the subcomponent of taxes or
expenditure only. The question, therefore, is “How closely does public finance
correlate with the economy?” In the last two decades, the results seem to be
mixed and confusing. Most researchers have examined and evaluated the
growth effect of subcomponents of taxes, such as income taxes, sale taxes,
property taxes, or direct and indirect taxes. In contrast, a large body of
literature has considered the influence of the share of government expenditure
on economic growth. However, evaluating a government’s capabilities may
require considering the full meaning of public finance. Additionally, a few
studies have revealed that the linkages between public finance and economic
growth are ambiguous, and need to be clarified (Dzhumashev, 2014.) That is
why this study measures public finance by the ratio between total tax revenue
and GDP and total general government expenditure per GDP rate and we try
to examine the relationship between these variables and economic growth to
fill in the above gap.

       Second, in the last two decades, both public choice theory and cost-
benefit theory posed the challenge for future research to determine the long-
term relationship of economic growth with public finance. In addition, short-
term effects of tax changes can be different from long-term effects because of
the elasticity of the demand curve. For planning future economic activities,
researchers should clarify these effects      (Stiglitz, 2000; Holley, 2011).
Additionally, determining the long-term economic relationship between tax
revenue and expenditure supports policymakers worldwide in designing
                                       12



appropriate policies for taxes and spending, as well as avoiding deficits.
However, until now, the results of empirical research seem to be mixed and
confusing. Moreover, tax revenue and expenditure are two major components
in the creation of a government budget (Holley, 2011; Hillman, 2009).
Governments will face a deficit if they spend more, or collect less in taxes.
Currently, the long-term relationship among tax revenue, expenditure, and
economic growth is an important challenge, attracting more research to aid
policymakers in developing appropriate fiscal policies for operating their
economies, and handling future deficits. That is why this study tries to confirm
the persistence of this relationship in the long term (See Lien and Thanh,
2017). In addition, to help the government to handle the deficit, policymakers
should understand the direction of links between tax revenue and expenditure.
This research continues to identify the direction between two major parts of
public finance: tax revenue and expenditure.”

       Third, the effects of corruption on economic activities and outcomes
are ambiguous and diverse. In the last decades, the results in the literature
about the role of corruption in economies are unclear. As we may know that,
each economy has both sides of the private sector and public sector. However,
public finance is a major factor that led to both private and public activities
depending on governance and its quality. Until now, governance theory
continues to argue the role of corruption and government in affecting the
relationship between economic growth and public finance. There are
numerous debates about the complicated role of corruption in economic
growth. Some previous researchers have said that corruption has a “greasing”
role and a “salting” role in the wheels of an economy, depending on different
groups of countries. Méon and Weill (2010) confirmed the hypothesis that
corruption is “efficient grease” in extremely inefficient countries and it is less
damaging to efficiency in countries with less institutional quality. Through
this research, we do not know how corruption does affect public finance and
                                      13



under effects of anti-corruption how public finance does promote the
economy. Bird et al. (2008) considered the tax revenue as a share of GDP and
could represent the tax effort or tax capacity of a country. They said that
control of corruption positively promotes tax revenue. Belkaoui (2008) used
the data of control of corruption following Kaufman (2004) for 30 developed
and developing countries and indicated that control of corruption has a
significantly positive effect on both tax compliance and tax expenditure in
both developed and developing countries. Nevertheless, two above studies did
not verify the influence of control of corruption on expenditure and growth.
Dzhumashev (2014) also showed that corruption forces government spending
to be more effective. He suggested that increasing levels of corruption may
improve economic growth in less developed countries, but it should be
detrimental in developed countries due to higher costs of private production.
d’Agostino et al. (2012) and Ugur (2014) indicated that corruption suggests
weakness of institutional quality, and has a potentially harmful effect on
economic growth. Moreover, d’Agostino et al. (2016) revealed that, although
corruption does not directly affect the growth of economies, its interaction
with spending on investment and military negatively affects economic growth.
In summary, only those countries that maintain a low corruption index achieve
high tax revenue, spend less, and maintain stable growth of their economy. In
the last decades, most previous scholars who assessed the crucial role of
corruption noted the “greasing or salting” of the wheels of an economy,
depending on the different groups of countries. There is little literature that
evaluates the way corruption modifies public finance before its direct effects
on economic activities. Furthermore, the relationship between anti-corruption
and other macroeconomic variables are complicated. The role of corruption in
an economy depends on government size, as well as the quality of governance,
and need to be clarified (Dzhumashev, 2014; Ugur 2014; Méon & Weill,
2010). Until now, the question: “How governance in anti-corruption does lead
                                          14



the public finance and economic growth?” The answer to this question
becomes challenged the economist in over the world.

1.3.   Research objectives and research questions

1.3.1 Research objectives

       This dissertation attempts to obtain the three below research objectives:

       First, this study investigates the long-run linkages between public
finance and economic growth. Examining the long-term relationships
between public finance and economic growth, encourages policymakers to
show greater diligence when issuing policies related to public finance and
growth, owing to the persistence of these variables.

       Second, to expand on the “tax and spend” hypothesis, this thesis
identifies the direction of causal linkage between tax revenue and
expenditure. The results may help governments balance spending and tax
collection in the future to control deficit. The research findings may aid
policymakers in better understanding the impact of these linkages, enabling
them to avoid risk factors in planning.

       Third, to contribute to the quality of governance theory and the
endogenous growth theory, this research evaluates the influence of
governance on the modifying effects of public finance on economic growth
differently according to different group countries. With this objective, the
study aims to help policymakers in both developed and developing countries
understand the role of corruption and public finance policy, so that they can
develop appropriate strategies in future.
                                       15



1.3.2. Research questions

       This study endeavors to answer the following questions to meet these
research objectives:

       (1)      How closely does public finance correlate with the economy in
the long run?

       (2)      Do tax revenue and government expenditure cause each other?

       (3)      How does governance modify the effects of public finance on
economic growth differently according to different group countries?

       As the research scope plays a crucial role in the research approach, the
next section will introduce the research scope.

1.4.    Research scope

        The study investigates linkages among government expenditures, tax
revenue, and economic growth for the whole sample (82 developed and
developing countries) in 21-year period 1996-2016.

        The reasons for choosing research objects and research period are:

        First, government expenditures and tax revenue are the key factors to
create and maintain a government budget. They also help policy makers
control deficits to maintain a stable economy.

        Second, control of corruption plays a crucial role in governance, which
says about cause of difference of rich and poor countries.

        Third, in the period 1996–2016, the global economy witnessed the post-
Asian financial crisis, which began in Thailand in 1997 and then affected the
stock markets of Asian countries such as Malaysia, Taiwan, and others. The
                                       16



second financial crisis rose when the real estate bubble exploded in the US in
2007, driving the US financial crisis and influencing production and exports in
numerous developing countries. First, for the less data bias from these crises,
this study used the annual inflation rate as a control variable in the estimating
model. Second, for solving the spillover effects of macroeconomic variables in
their relationship with economic growth as well as deeper effects of two
financial crises, this research applied the SUR model for estimation effect of
public finance and control of corruption. Additionally, SUR model helps
researchers gain more efficiency than a single equation.

       Fourth, the differences of collection taxes, spending status, GDP per
capita and governance showed a big gap between developed economies and
developing economies, which attracts a large of literature and needs to be
clarified. Developing countries obtain the more than 60% of population of the
world, but contribute less than 30% to global GDP (Spence, 2011).

1.5.   Research methods

1.5.1. Research methods

       First, for the first research question, this study employs a co-integration
test to examine the long-run relationships among variables. As we may know
that, an co-integration test is often applied to investigate the long-run
relationships between stationary variables (Ojede & Yamarik, 2012).
Additionally, the existence of co-integration among nonstationary variables
could avoid spurious regression (Gujarati, 2004; Persyn & Westerlund, 2008).
There are numerous researchers who have designed co-integration tests to
prevent spurious regression, such as McCoskey and Kao (1999), Bai and Ng
(2004), Pedroni (2004), Breitung and Pesaran (2005), Westerlund and
Edgerton (2008), and Persyn and Westerlund (2008). We follow Persyn and
Westerlund’s (2008) test to identify the existence of co-integration linkages
                                       17



among the variables in this study. This test is very flexible technique and
allows for an almost completely heterogeneous specification of the long-run
portions of the error correction model, where the latter can be determined from
the data.

       Next, the Granger test result helps this thesis to answer the research
question 2. The Granger’s techniques could support this study to identify the
direction of the link between tax revenue and expenditure.

       Furthermore, to reduce bias from extracting data in the period, which
witnessed two financial crises and to ensure the efficient result of estimation
from the system equations, this study employs a SUR model and two-step
SGMM to estimate the role of governance in modifying the effect of public
finance on economic growth.

1.5.2. The research data

       This study uses the strongly balanced panel data for 82 developed and
developing countries from 1996 to 2016 (see table appendix A1). We
extracted the data of GDP per capita, the ratio between trade value and GDP,
inflation rate and foreign direct net inflow from World Banks’ database -
World Development Indicators (WDI). To measure the role of governance,
this study collects the “control of corruption indicators” from World Bank’s
database - World Governance Indicators (WGI). In this study, the public
finance variable was presented by the ratio between total tax revenue and GDP
and the rate of total government expenditure and GDP, which were selected
from International Monetary Fund (IMF)’s database - Government finance
statistic (GFS). In addition, tries to investigate the role of human capital, this
                                               18



research collect the data of human development index (HDI3) from United
Nations Development Program (UNDP).

        Additionally, the control of corruption indicator denotes a perception of
private, elite governors and foreign investors about the public powers
exercising for the private firms only. For a robustness check of the role of
governance, this study continues to explore the corruption perception index of
business developed by Transparency International website (TI). The results
may support this research’s contribution toward determining the role of
governance in an economy.

1.6.    Research contribution

Contribution to public choice and cost-benefit literature

        This thesis examines the long run relationship between public finance,
governance and economic growth in developed and developing countries over
the period 1996–2016. Furthermore, this thesis also evaluates the role of
governance in modifying the influences of public finance on economic
growth.

       The first research objective is to verify the persistence of a long-run
relationship between public finance and economic growth in both developed
and developing economies. The finding supports the long run relationship
between public finance and economic growth. By adding the ratio between
total tax revenue and GDP as well as the rate of government expenditure to
GDP into economic growth model, this study enlarges the generation of
economic growth by public finance’s factors. Furthermore, this finding also
supports the policymakers to concentrate on the relationship between public

finance and economic growth in the long-run for their developing appropriate
fiscal policies in future.

      The second research objective is to confirm the taxation and spending
hypothesis of a bi-directional causal linkage between total tax revenue and
general government spending. This result supports the synchronization
hypothesis and confirms the public choice theory and the cost-benefit theory
as well as trade-off theory. The finding suggests that policymakers in both
developed and developing countries should focus on the role of every type of
tax rate, tax base and the whole objectives of the government expenditure
simultaneously to promote economies and handle the deficit.

      The findings of the first and second research objectives help this study
become one of the scarce studies, which provide the evidence to prove the
long run theory of the links between total tax revenue and general government
expenditure as well as the long-run theory of economic growth in handling
deficit and promoting growth in an economy.

      Evaluating the influences of governance on modifying public finance and
promoting economic growth is the third research objective. Firstly,
investigating the effects of governance and public finance on economic growth
helps this study to indicate that public finance differently affects economic
growth depending on government taxes or spending. Secondly, the effect of
interaction between governance and public finance makes government
expenditure become a beneficial factor for economic growth. These findings
provide the evidence supporting the theory of quality of government as well as
the public choice theory for both developed and developing countries.

Contribution to empirical study

       Until now, both the public choice theory and cost-benefit theory posed
big challenges to academic researchers in examining the role of public finance
and governance on economic growth. Few previous studies argued about the
role of the subcomponent of tax revenue and each part of government
expenditure on economic growth in the short run. By applying the co-
integration test and Granger test for a panel data of 82 developed and
developing countries over the period 1996 - 2015, which witnessed the two
financial crises, this thesis bridges the gap in understanding the long run
relationship among public finance, governance and economic growth.
Additionally, this result also supports that the long-run relationship between
public finance and economic growth has existed during the crisis time.

1.7.   Structure of dissertation

       This thesis is presented in the following structure. After the abstract,
the key sections are:

Chapter 1: Introduction

       First, this chapter provides an overview of the theoretical and empirical
background related to government expenditure, tax revenue, corruption, and
economic growth. Second, this chapter also presents a summary and outline of
the research. Last, this chapter provides the evidences of research gaps.

Chapter 2: Literature review, and hypotheses development

       This chapter introduces the critical literature review of the growth
effects of government expenditure, tax revenue, and control of corruption. It
presents the methodology used by previous researchers to analyze research
                                      21



data. Moreover, this chapter also interprets the impact of the regimes under
which the research variables affect economic growth.

Chapter 3: methods and research data

      Chapter 3 introduces the methods that this research applies to achieve
the research objectives; for instance, Granger causality, co-integration tests,
SUR and two-step SGMM models. Base on the characteristic of these
methods, this chapter also presents the research data and sources from which
the data were extracted, such as the WDI and WGI from the World Bank’s
database, the WEO from the IMF’s database, and corruption perception index
of business (CPI) from the Transparency International (TI)’s database.

Chapter 4: Public finance, governance and economic growth: A long-run
analysis

      Chapter 4 interprets the empirical research results that introduce the
confirmation of a long-run economic relationship with two factors of public
finance: tax revenue and government expenditure. The research findings in
this chapter also confirm the direction of the causal linkage between tax
revenue    and   government     expenditure,   which     supports   the   fiscal
synchronization hypothesis and suggests that policy makers implement joint
decision making for taxes and spending.

      Chapter 4 also presents the means through which control of corruption
affects the influences between public finance and economic growth depending
on the economic group.

Chapter 5: Conclusions, implications, and limitations:

      This chapter first summarizes the research results in general. Second,
based on the major research results, chapter 5 makes recommendations to help
policy makers and governments design appropriate policies for improving
                                       22



their economies, as well as for handling corruption. Furthermore, this chapter
discusses the study’s limitations and opportunities for future research.

                                 CHAPTER 2:
 LITERATURE REVIEW AND HYPOTHESES DEVELOPMENT


2.1. Introduction

       Public finance and governance play a crucial role in economic
activities. Answering the question “How does this factor affect economic
outcomes?” may help governments issue appropriate policies, and enable their
society and economy to become more stable. First, this chapter sheds light on
the literature regarding the relationships among public finance, and economic
growth in long-term and in both developed and developing countries. Second,

2.2. Some key concepts

2.2.1. Public finance

       Public finance influences economic activities daily because of the
relationship between government expenditure in providing public goods and
the capacity of tax collection (Philips, 1957). Wagner (1883) noted that the
science of public finance understands the nature of a fiscal economy; this
addresses the two specific characteristics of a state, consumption and income,
which should be understood as government expenditure and tax revenue.

       According to the traditional approach to public finance, we learn that
public finance is a subcomponent in classical, neo-classical, and Keynesian
economics. Taxes and expenditure are two factors that have been studied to
identify their effect on the activities of firms, families, and individuals. People
always make choices that will result in their highest utility, so any change
related to public policy or public finance could affect the benefits of all
partners in society (Buchanan, 1999.)

       Hillman (2009) indicated that government has three major duties:
preserving microeconomic stability, reducing unemployment and inflation,
and maintaining the stability of banking and financial systems through public
finance and public policy.

       Gruber (2011) shed light on how public finance enables governments to
deal with economic crises. On the expenditure side of public finance,
governments should decide what kinds of goods or services it could provide.
On the taxes side, governments should answer the question: “How much
should a government tax its citizens?”
                                          25



          McGee (2013) suggests that to understand public finance, we should try
   to answer the question “What should government do to provide its services
   and lead private firms as well as individuals to agree to pay taxes?”

          In summary, in last two decades, most authors have considered public
   finance as a tool that supports governments in determining the level of
   spending for providing public goods or services to society. Furthermore,
   public finance is a technique that can help governments make decisions
   regarding the level of taxes to charge its citizens for better provision of public
   goods in the future, as well as a means through which governments can control
   deficits. Two major components of public finance are tax revenue and
   government expenditure, as documented by Buchanan (1999), Wellisch
   (2004), Kaul and Conceição (2006), and McGee (2013).”

a) Tax revenue

          “Hillman (2009) considered that tax revenue includes different types of
   taxes and is a major source for financing government spending. Moreover, tax
   revenue can be changed when tax rates are increased. Wellisch (2004)
   suggested that the countries that produce products should collect the tax
   revenue, shifting the tax burden to residents of the countries where the goods
   are consumed.

          McGee (2008) described tax revenue as a tool, which evaluates the
   capacity of a country to enhance its tax efforts. Furthermore, tax revenue as a
   percentage of GDP represents the variable for fiscal freedom. As measured by
   the ratio of tax revenue to GDP, most developing countries collect only two-
   thirds of the amount collected by high-income countries (Rizvi, Bacha, &
   Mirakhor, 2016)”
                                        26



b) Government expenditure

                “Holley (2011) confirmed that governments spending tax
   revenue to promote production and consumption is called tax expenditure. In
   less developed countries, governments always face the pressure of economic
   development; thus, they should increase expenditure as well as enhance tax
   revenue to help them to generate more money (Philips, 1957).”

         In summary, we can apply the geometric shape shown in figure 2.1 to
   describe the flow of creating a government budget.




                    Figure 2.1: Public sector in the economy
                   Source: Musgrave and Musgrave (1989, p.16)

         “In figure 2.1, the solid lines represent income and spending in the
   private sector. The broken lines indicate the public sector. First, we suppose
   that there is no public sector in the market. Household income comes from
                                       27



sales (line 1), which is then spent (line 4) or saved (line 5). Using savings,
households can finance (line 6). Lines 6 and 4 combine the purchase of
products in product markets. When a government exists in the market, it can
spend on public factors (line 2) or private products (line 7), and then payments
are transferred (line 8). Additionally, governments could obtain revenue from
the collection of taxes (line 9) and from borrowing (line 10).”

       This figure provides a simplified view of the interaction between public
and private sectors in an economy. Figure 2.1 also indicates those whole
objectives of government expenditure should affect the all of activities in the
economy.

2.2.2. Governance and corruption

       Hague and Martin (2004) confirmed that governance stands for the
activities of making collective decisions. Therefore, these authors argued that
the government’s decisions depend on the authority, who is the right to act,
rather than the power to do. However, an authority creates its own power so
long as people accept that the authority figure has the right to make decisions,
so control of corruption or corruption may have an important role in the
process of governance. Additionally, Dzhumashev (2014) argued that
corruption represents the quality of governance and influences an economy’s
private and public production through its impact on the effectiveness of
government spending as well as the control of production costs. In
comparison, Ugur (2014) debated that corruption stands for institutional
quality and has diverse effects on the income per capita of an economy.

       “A substantial amount of literature in recent decades has introduced
the concept of corruption. Cintra et al. (2017) confirmed that the concept of
corruption is somewhat diverse, and that it was the most cited concept in
articles in Scopus from 2000 to 2010. Corruption primarily injures the poor,
                                        28



and it can subvert public support by creating an incorrect perception that
corruption affects all progress. Furthermore, corruption impedes the access of
developing countries to private capital (World Bank, 1997). Jain (2001)
identified three types of corruption. First, “grand corruption” refers to issuance
of economic policies based on the power of politicians. Second, “bureaucratic
corruption” is a petty form of corruption and refers to acts of a bureaucrat
when dealing with others and using their power to accomplish a task; the third
is corruption in making laws or voting for something. Through this literature,
we can see that corruption is a complex phenomenon that has a complicated
effect on economic activities. Grossman (2003) noted that government
corruption is disloyalty of an officer, which may be one of the following
behaviors: bribery, fraud, graft, extortion, embezzlement, influence peddling,
ticket fixing, or nepotism. He also argued that political corruption has four
definitions. First, corruption is an illegal behavior, such as bribery. The second
meaning involves an unethical benefaction. Third, corruption may be a
conflict of interest on the part of a government officer. Finally, corruption can
be related to political behavior that is a nonresponse to the public interest.

       Capasso and Santoro (2017) divided corruption into two groups: active
corruption and passive corruption. Government officials using their power to
demand benefits or money in dealing with private suppliers that provide public
goods is an example of active corruption. People or private firms who want to
give money or some other benefit to obtain a major agreement are engaged in
passive corruption. They also conducted an empirical study using Italian data
and noted that active and passive corruption has different effects on
government expenditure. In most cases, the corruption that was pointed out
involved public officials using their position to maximize their income by
employing market mechanisms to make business decisions (Cintra et al., 2017;
Brianzoni, Campisi, & Russo, 2017.)
                                       29



         Jain (2001) and Cintra et al. (2017) confirmed that not only is the
definition of corruption complex, but that corruption can also be difficult to
measure. A few ways of measuring corruption are described below.

         First, Business International Corporation (BI), which merged with the
Economist Intelligence Unit, previously published ratings assessing corruption
by collecting and analyzing network data around the world. The ratings were
first published for the period 1981–1983; Mauro (1995) may have been the
first author to use this data.

         Second, Political Risk Services, Inc. publishes an annual report called
the “International Country Risk Guide” (ICRG), which includes a corruption
index.

         Third, the World Economic Forum in Switzerland has published the
Global Competitiveness Report since 1989, which reports the minimum
degree of care in academic research as corruption.

         Fourth, the Transparency International organization focuses on bribery,
measuring the perception of corruption in different countries, and created a
“Bribe Payers Index” in 1999.

         A group of researchers lead by Kaufmann, Kraay, and Mastruzzi (2011)
created six world government indicators that include a control of corruption
index.

         Furthermore, previous empirical studies have often measured
corruption at the country level using summary indexes (e.g., Transparency
International’s Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) or the World Bank’s
Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI)) (Nguyen et al., 2016). This
supports using both CPI and WGI in this study to verify the role of governance
in control of corruption.
                                       30



          To understand the regime of corruption that affects other activities,
previous authors designed two major models. First, the agency model uses the
equilibrium equation to balance the interests of officials and their elected
power and explain the existence of corruption and its influence on economic
activities (Barro, 1973; Mauro, 1995; Bird, Martinez-Vazquez & Torgler,
2008; Beekman, Bulte & Nillesen, 2013; Angelucci & Russo, 2015; Aghion et
al., 2016). Second, the resource allocation model applied and expanded the
production function to show the causes of corruption and its impact on
economic outcomes (Ajaz & Ahmad, 2010; Brianzoni, Campisi & Russo,
2017.)”Qiao and Shah (2006) noted that in China, the tax revenue task gives
government officials the opportunity to engage in corruption and rent seeking.
Acemoglu (2008) emphasized that when governments in poor countries make
decisions, it leads to distorted incentives in the marketplace and increases
corruption. Hillman (2009) defined governance is the performance of activities
exercised by government officials. Good governance is a government that
serves its taxpayers well. In contrast, bad or inadequate governance is a
government that has the authority to serve taxpayers in ways that obtain more
benefits for government officials’ families and friends than for taxpayers or
voters.

          Folow Dzhumashev (2014) and Ugur (2014)s’ argument, this study
uses control of corruption indicator extracted from World Bank’s database to
evaluate the quality of governance. However, this indicator represents the
perception of private, elite governors and foreign investors about the public
powers exercising for the private firms only. That is also a reason to promote
this study by applying the other indicator, for example, corruption perception
index - CPI to confirm the reliable results of evaluating the effects of
governance. According to the Transparency International, we know that this
organization collected CPI from two different types of source: business
people’s opinion survey and assessment scores of a country’s performance
                                      31



provided by a group countries’ expert analysis. In addition, both indicators
have the same meaning. In the country gained the higher index, the area
obtained the free of corruption. The control of corruption (CCI) range lies
from -2.5 to 2.5. The corruption perception index stays from 1 to 100 score.

      2.2.3 Economic growth

   “Economic growth plays a crucial role in society and determines the living
conditions of people around the world. There is a great deal of literature on
economic growth. First, classical economists posited that economic growth
depends only on population (labor force) and physical capital (Smith, 1776;
Ricardo, 1821; Schumpeter, 1942.) The simple Cobb-Douglas production
function (𝑌 = 𝐹(𝐾, 𝐿)) was a popular function used in early research to
examine economic growth.

   Neo-classical scholars indicated that growth in economies is created by
increasing output or changing GDP per worker (Samuelson, 1954; Solow,
1956; Swan, 1956.) They explained the differences in economic outcomes by
applying external factors: human capital, physical capital, and transforming
technologies. They designed an economic model, 𝑌 = 𝐴𝐾 𝛼 𝐿1−𝛼 , where Y is
productivity, A denotes technology process, and K and L are physical capital
and human capital, respectively.”

   The limitation of both the classical and neo-classical models, as most
scholars have explained, is that in the long run, growth in GDP per capita is
driven by exogenous technological change. These theorists did not consider
the potential accumulation or dissipation of physical and human capital in the
long run.

   Barro (1991) and Mankiw et al. (1992) developed the growth equation
following Solow’s style:
                                        32



   𝐿𝑜𝑔 (𝑌𝑖,𝑡 ) − 𝐿𝑜𝑔(𝑌𝑖,0 ) = 𝛽𝐿𝑜𝑔(𝑌𝑖,0 ) + 𝑋𝛼 + 𝑍𝜑 + 𝜀𝑖 ,   where    𝐿𝑜𝑔 (𝑌𝑖,𝑡 )
stands for logarithm of economic growth of country i at time t, 𝑋𝛼 is a matrix
vector of independent variables, 𝑍𝜑 denotes the vectors of control variables
and 𝜀𝑖 indicates the vector of unobserved error term. Furthermore, Islam
(1995) put the growth model in context of dynamic panel data and designed
this above equation as seen as below:

   𝐿𝑜𝑔(𝑌𝑖,𝑡 ) = 𝑏𝐿𝑜𝑔(𝑌𝑖,𝑡−1 ) + 𝑋𝛼 + 𝑍𝜑 + 𝜇𝑖 + 𝜗𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑡,

                         𝑏 = (1 + 𝛽) → 𝛽 = (𝑏 − 1)

   Barro and Sala-i-Martin (2004) supposed that government finances its
expenditure for public goods and service with lump-sum taxes and they
designed the new production function to measure the income as seen as below:

   𝑌 = 𝐴𝐿𝐾 𝛼 𝐺 1−𝛼 , where G stands for quantity of public goods

   These authors also argued that the total tax revenue collected is 𝜏𝑌 so the
growth account will be: 𝑌 = 𝑅. 𝐾 + 𝜔. 𝐿 + 𝜏. 𝑌, where 𝜏 is average of tax rate
between 𝜏𝐾 + 𝜏𝐿

   Through this argument, we found that tax revenue and government
expenditure give the direct effects on both major input factors of production
function: physical capital and labor’s capital (K & L in above equation), it also
has indirect influence on technology (A) so this debate shows the complicated
path of indirect impact of taxes and expenditure on economic income and need
to be clarified. However, these authors considered the relationship between
direct taxes, government expenditure, and economic growth only. In each
society, we should examine the links among total tax revenue, general
government expenditure and economic growth to support policymakers.
                                        33



   Martínez-Vázquez, Vulovic, and Moreno-Dodson (2012)                     defined
economic growth by GINI coefficient and designed the below equation to
measure economic growth:

   𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑖,𝑡 = 𝛼𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑖,𝑡−1 + 𝛾𝐹𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛽𝑋𝑖,𝑡 + 𝜗𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖,𝑡, i=1,….n and t=1,…T where
𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑖,𝑡 stands for gini coefficient of a country i at time t, while 𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑖,𝑡−1
represents its value at time t-1. 𝐹𝑖,𝑡 is a vector of fiscal variables saying about
the component of taxes such as personal income tax (PIT), companies’ income
tax (CIT), social security contribution (SSC), payroll taxes, general sales tax
(GST) and custom duties. 𝑋𝑖,𝑡 indicates the vector of control variables:
population growth, age dependency, the level of globalization, GDP per capita
growth, unemployment, the corruption, education level, and the size of
government. 𝜗𝑖 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝜀𝑖,𝑡 present the unobserved and observed error term.

   In addition, a small group of authors computed the average or five-year
average of the GDP per capita growth rate to evaluate the growth level of the
economy (Kormendi, 1985; Landau, 1985; Grier & Tullock, 1989; Devarajan
et al., 1996; Kneller et al., 1999). However, Barro (1991) argued that this rate
might provide the bias data after calculation. In general, most researchers have
evaluated economic growth using GDP per capita (see Barro, 1991; Acemoglu
et al., 2003, 2008; Johansson et al., 2008 ; Romero-Ávila & Strauch, 2008;
Ojede & Yamarik, 2012; d'Agostino et al., 2016). This variable indicates the
full meaning of capability of an economy, which considered the quantity of
human resource. That is a reason why this research uses real GDP per capita to
measure economic growth.

2.3 Theoretical literature on the relationship between public finance and
economic growth

2.3.1 Public choice theory
                                      34



       The public choice theory explains how government and politicians
work using the methods and tools of economics. This theory also provides a
mechanism for allocating resources (Buchanan, 1999; Stiglitz, 2000). There
are two sides to the argument in public choice theory. On the one hand, some
researchers have indicated that the government is not concerned with the
trade-off theory; therefore, they may be willing to collect more tax or cut
spending to reduce the deficit. On the other hand, if the government confirms
the role of the trade-off theory, it always tries to grow and will attempt to
collect more tax and spend less. At present, we do not clearly know which
argument is more helpful for policymakers. Furthermore, Stiglitz (2000)
indicated that governments always think that increasing public expenditure
will make their countries richer. The evidence of government spending in
developing countries from 1996 to 2016 supports this argument (see figure
1.5). Additionally, developing countries try to grow, inevitably trading off
their expenditure or land to develop infrastructure, agriculture, and human
capital (Kanter et al., 2016; Liu, 2017; Beauchamp, Clements and Milner-
Gulland, 2018.) All we may know that tax revenue decides the cost of public
goods and services. Therefore, political making decision is a complex process.
The fiscal process always poses a double choice: one choice or decision
related to a size of public spending and the other a choice or decision on the
rates of taxes (Buchanan, 1999.)

       Furthermore, this theory also poses a challenge for future research due
to the persistence of the link between tax revenue and government
expenditure. Each individual has a different preferred level of public spending.
Additionally, total tax revenue is based on multipliers between the total type
of tax base and tax rates, which may drive the activities of all people in an
economy. Furthermore, the popular government often refers to what people
want to make decisions. How does the government make its decision since
different people prefer different things (Buchanan, 2009; Kaul and Conceição,
                                         35



2006; Stiglitz, 2000)? Until now, the public choice theory may not fix this
issue. That is why we should try to analyze the long-run relationship between
total tax revenue and government expenditure as well as the correlation
between public finance and economic growth.”

2.3.2. Cost-benefit theory of taxation

       Dasgupta and Pearce (1972) noted that cost-benefit analysis (CBA)
relates to the term of social gains and losses. However, real benefits and costs
may be both direct and indirect. Direct costs and benefits are those related to
project objectives, whereas indirect benefits and costs reflect the nature of
products (Musgrave & Musgrave, 1989). Schmid (2004) indicated that cost-
benefit analysis is a set of economic tools for evaluating budget size, public
spending, and regulation. Following cost-benefit analysis, we know that a
deficit may be a big challenge, which hinders creating a budget (McGee,
2008). To better handle a deficit, government should thoroughly understand
the relationship between tax revenue and government spending. Meltzer and
Richard (1981) assumed that in an economy, people have different choices of
work or leisure and consumption. These activities affect wages, income tax,
and the way government pays for public goods, so they showed that
government should balance the amount of government spending and the
collection of taxes. However, this study evaluated only the relationships
among individuals’ labour choices, income tax, and government expenditure.
To evaluate the full capacity of government, we should investigate total tax
revenue and total expenditure.”

       Based on cost-benefit theory, there is a large body of theoretical
research on the relationship between government expenditure and growth of
economies, but the arguments are too complicated. Barro (1990) debated that
the source of government spending is equal to tax revenue: 𝑔 = 𝑇 = 𝜏. 𝑦 =
                                      36



       𝑔
𝜏. 𝑘. ∅( ), where g is government spending, T denotes tax revenue, and 𝜏 is
       𝑘

the income tax rate. However, governments create budgets from tax revenue
based on government expenditure and household spending, so 𝑇 = (𝜏. 𝑔 +
𝜏. ℎ)𝑦, where h is household expenditures. Based on Barro’s argument, the
confusion is that government expenditure depends on tax revenue, but we can
collect tax revenue after the government and households make expenditures.
This debate is a reason for future research, which more clearly defines his idea
and to answer the question: “How do tax revenue, expenditure, and the
economy relate to each other?"”

       In addition, Barro Sala-i-Martin (1992) confirmed that in an
endogenous growth model (𝑌 = 𝐴𝐾1−𝛼 𝐺 𝛼 , where G is government purchase).
The government’s selection of tax rates and expenditure level is a key cause of
different long-term growth. Based on their argument, investors are sensitive to
the tax rate. Investment is a crucial element in a growth model. This study
argued the role of government in leading private investment as well as
providing public goods or services through its spending and taxes. However,
Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1992), and Johansson et al. (2008) verified only a
part of taxes. Additionally, government spending affects both consumption
and production markets. Taxes, which include both direct and indirect taxes,
are known to be an effective tool used to finance public goods. When people
earn income, they pay a direct tax. When people spend their income, they pay
indirect taxes (Hillman, 2009). He also indicated that tax revenue is a
multiplier between the tax rate and tax base. Based on his argument, we know
that politicians are sensitive to the Laffer curve, so tax rates or tax bases
depend on their preference. If a politician prefers to spend more, he will
increase the tax rate, while other politicians who want to increase revenue
should reduce the tax rate or expand the tax base. A lower tax rate attracts
investors because they understand that when investment grows, tax revenue
                                       37



will also rise. There is much literature on the role of public spending, and it is
also ambiguous (Dzhumashev 2014). In more detail, Samuelson (1954)
disputed that in each economy, there are two types of goods: private
consumption goods and collective consumption goods. If individuals prefer
both types of goods, then each individual tries to maximize his or her utility.
The government expenditure affects gross domestic economic growth
depending on the way those expenditures are made. Most research showed the
method of growth affects public finance and governance quality through
aggregate demand or supply. Based on utility function, previous researchers
have argued that public finance or governance quality impacts individual
consumption of public and private goods, and these independent variables
continue to affect the aggregated outcome of the economy.

       In short, until now, cost-benefit theory has posed a challenge to
academic researchers, who are interested in verifying the relationship between
tax revenue and expenditure. Most previous studies did not clearly confirm the
hypotheses of relationship between total tax revenue and general government
expenditure in both developed and developing countries. Therefore, these are
also key tools to support government control of deficits to maintain stable
economies.

2.3.3. Governance theory

       “Governments play an important role in the organization of society and
law, as well as increasing economic growth. However, attaining a balance
between income and spending always constitutes a big challenge for them.
Stiglitz (2000) indicated that the government is concerned with all economic
activities and devises and maintains a legal framework that covers all
transactions within an economy. Hillman (2004) reviewed the existing studies,
and revealed that public finance is a tool that helps government in low-income
countries increase economic growth and reduces poverty. He proved that
                                       38



corruption in these countries makes governments ineffective in spending and
in collecting taxes. He also indicated that corruption might come from
government regulation, taxation, procurement, and public spending for private
benefit. Nevertheless, this research tries to describe the way that corruption
affects society and economies. First, corruption has an inverse link with low
wages for government officials. Second, corruption is a means of helping
leaders or rulers support their authority. Third, rent seeking and corruption
make distribution of natural resources more distorted. Fourth, corruption
inhibits economic development because it reduces the effectiveness of private
investment and discriminates against small enterprises or start-up companies.
Fifth, corruption reduces tax revenue and makes public spending ineffective.
Sixth, he also posed the argument that there may be more or less corruption in
fiscal decentralization, which is a debate that should be further investigated in
future research. Seventh, corruption shows the inequality in income
distribution and affects taxation. Last, he also confirmed that governments in
transition economies should reform their policies to reduce the corruption
perception index to improve their governance. In summary, this study revealed
that the role of corruption in the effectiveness of public finance and inhibition
of economic development in developing countries needs to be verified in
future research.

       Dzhumashev (2014) performed theoretical research on both sides of
corruption, such as households and politicians, and mentioned that corruption
has a close relationship to the quality of governance. Corruption can shift the
difference of the optimal size of government and become a useful factor to
enhance economic growth. Countries with poor governance could spend more
than the optimal level, so corruption can support them in developing their
economy. This finding shows the limitation of research that studies the role of
corruption in an economy without the linkage between quality of governance
and government size with corruption.
                                       39



       Applying the Nash equilibrium to analyze the Greek economy, Litina
and Palivos (2016) noted that a good way to keep a unique equilibrium is to
impose a strong moral cost on corrupt politicians and tax evaders, two agents
who try to gain more individual benefits.

       Célimène et al. (2016) indicated a different way that households and
politicians used refunds from tax evasion. Private investors can re-invest their
gains from tax evasion to develop production, which can increase the
economy. However, the benefits gained by politicians from household bribes
can be used only for individual purposes. From this debate, we can learn that
corruption has different effects depending on how transactions of corruption
benefit both politicians and households in a society.

       In summary, governance theory confirm the linkage between quality of
governance, government size, and corruption, so to verify the role of
corruption in economic growth, researchers should care about both sides of an
economy; in other words, the private sector and politicians. In addition,
corruption and quality of governance also lead to activities in the private
sector as well as the public sector, like tax revenue and government
expenditure. Until now, these theories have only considered the role of
corruption and governance in an economy, or in the composition of taxes or
spending. However, total tax revenue and spending are two major factors in
creating government budget and in establishing inputs for production. These
factors also represent the full capability of government, and the relationship
between them and economic growth in the presence of corruption and
governance needs to be clarified.”

2.3.4. Economic growth theory: Exogenous and endogenous growth theory

       “Barro and Sala-i-Martin (2004) confirmed that a small rate of
economic growth plays an important role in increasing standards of living;
                                      40



however, the way governments choose policies could affect long-term growth
rates. These authors also indicated that in the mid-1980s, due to the complex
definition of capital, the neoclassical or exogenous theories become
unsatisfactory tools for determining long-run growth. This study also
considers that economic activities depend on the actions of firms and
government decisions in creating budgets and spending. Furthermore, these
decisions may affect standards of living, which affect the quality of human
capital as well as technological capital. These two capital resources can
increase or reduce aggregated total productivity in a society. Based on this
argument, endogenous growth theory can help researchers explain growth
better than exogenous theories.

      Acemoglu (2009) mentioned that the differences in growth rates many
times make a country become richer than other countries. Therefore,
understanding growth theory is necessary for today’s policy makers to
increase income per capita. Acemoglu (2009) also revealed that previous
researchers emphasized that specific characteristics of a country may relate to
economic growth, such as investment, physical and human capital,
technology, policies, culture, and exogenous environmental factors.

      Aghion and Howitt (2009) also argued that economic growth was
measured by GDP per capita, so neoclassical theory did not explain the
changed rate of technological progress. The endogenous growth model can
enable researchers to correct this issue and determine growth in a long-run
relationship with endogenous factors. These researchers presented the AK
model, which adds more explanation of the accumulation of knowledge of
human capital in determining the growth of an economy.

      In addition, tax revenue steers the provision of public goods, which
drives economic growth more than capital accumulation (Cerqueti and
Coppier, 2011.)
                                       41



       Furthermore, Aghion et al. (2016) proved that the less effective
governance reduces the positive impact of taxes on growth. The effectiveness
of governance also increases tax rates, which has a U-shaped effect on growth
equilibrium.

       Célimène et al. (2016) explained that tax evasion and tax corruption
affect private capital and public spending, which are two inputs in the
production function. This argument supports the role of taxes and corruption
in driving economic growth.

       Additionally, tax revenue and public expenditure are two major factors
in the production function. Total tax revenue and total expenditure can
indicate the capacity of a government. Currently, endogenous growth theory
continues to require more verification of the relationships among tax revenue,
government expenditure, and economic growth.”

2.4 Empirical literature on relationships among public finance,
governance, and economic growth

2.4.1 Empirical literature on relationships between public finance, and
economic growth

       According to Barro’s (1990) perspective, which explained the role of
the interaction between government expenditure and taxes in household
spending and income, we know that this might be a too simple social regime,
where governments only collect taxes from income and property. The
limitation of this research is that it does not evaluate the relationship between
total tax revenue and total public spending, which articulates government
capability.

       In recent decades, two stances have emerged for evaluating the
relationship between public finance and economic growth. First, a few
                                     42



scholars applied causality and co-integration tests to confirm the correlation
between economic growth and tax structure or share of expenditure only (Ray,
Pal & Ray, 2012; Azam et al., 2015.) Second, a group of researchers adopted
the endogenous growth model to examine the linkage between a part of tax
revenue or share of government expenditure and economic only. For instance:
Landau (1983, 1985), Grier & Tullock (1989), Barro (1990, 1991), Hitiris and
Posnett (1992), Mankiw et al. (1992), Devarajan et al. (1996), Fölster and
Henrekson (2001), Bassanini and Scarpetta (2002), Lee and Gordon (2005),
Aizenman and Glick (2006), Arnold (2008), Romero- Ávila and Strauch
(2008), Cooray (2009), Baltagi and Moscone (2010), Mercan et al. (2010),
Ojede and Yamarik (2012), Azam et al. (2015) d'Agostino et al. (2016),
Stoilova (2017), Ramírez, Díaz and Bedoya (2017).

      In some previous studies, the income tax, sale tax, or property tax are
very significant in reducing economic results in both developing and
developed economies (Lee & Gordon, 2005; Ojede & Yamarik, 2012; Amir et
al., 2013; Adkisson & Mohammed, 2014). In addition, Bujang et al. (2013)
employed Kao’s co-integration test for a panel dataset of 24 developing and 24
developed countries over a 10-year period and found that tax structure and
GDP in developing countries do not have a long-run co-integrating
relationship, which only exist in developed countries. Furthermore, Easterly
and Rebelo (1993) revealed that taxes that come from the income of any
person or organization can make an economy to grow, while import or export
tax may reduce it.

      Other earlier authors also confirmed the mixed growth effect of
government expenditure and tax revenue. By performing an empirical study of
98 countries from 1960 to 1985, Barro (1991) indicated that the relationship
between public spending and economic growth is negative. Furthermore,
Hitiris and Posnett (1992) analyzed the data of 20 OECD countries over a 28-
                                         43



year period and found that when a government uses expense for caring their
peoples’ health, this spending can increase the country’s income per head.
Applying OLS, fixed effects (FE), and pooled OLS techniques; Kneller et al.
(1999) performed an analysis of a dataset of 22 developed countries between
1970 and 1995 and found that government spending positively affects income
per capita, while taxation has a harmful effect on this variable. How do tax
revenue and expenditure affect economic growth? Are their effects differ
according to different economic groups? The next section of this thesis will
show the solution for these questions.

       According to Barro’s (1990) argument, a government could raise the
tax rate or expand the tax base to increase revenue. However, any action
related to increasing taxes may be detrimental to private investment and thus
lessen the economic outcome. Although earlier research verified the impacts
of these components of public factors on growth, at this time we do not easily
arrive at a study that examines the effect of total tax revenue and general
government expenditure on the economy. The research findings for cluster
data may give an insufficient view of problems regarding the relationship
between public finance and the economy. In this case, conducting
experimental research with total tax revenue and general government
expenditure could help researchers get a full view of the capability of a
government and the economic situation.

       From the nineteenth century, most scholars have considered the
important role of tax revenue and government expenditure in creating
government budgets as well as in providing fiscal regulations for conducting
economic activities. On the one hand, some authors have indicated that public
finance has a negative or positive effect on the economy, depending on the
type of economy (Landau 1983,1985; Grier & Tullock, 1989; Barro, 1991;
Mankiw et al., 1992; Fölster & Henrekson, 2001; Cooray, 2009; Azam et al.,
                                      44



2015; Lien & Thanh, 2017). While, other authors have shed light of that public
finance depends on the kind of taxes or government spending and diversely
affects economy (see Barro, 1990, 1991; Hitiris & Posnett, 1992; Devarajan et
al., 1996; Bassanini & Scarpetta, 2002; Lee & Gordon, 2005; Aizenman &
Glick, 2006; Arnold, 2008; Romero-Ávila & Strauch, 2008; Cooray, 2009;
Baltagi & Moscone, 2010; Mercan et al., 2010; Ojede & Yamarik, 2012;
d'Agostino et al., 2016; Stoilova, 2017). In contrast, other scholars confirmed
the causal linkage between tax revenue or government spending and economic
growth (Ray, Pal & Ray, 2012; Azam et al., 2015). Based on the complicated
debates of the relationship between public finance and economic growth, we
realize that this argument needs to be clarified and explored to explain the
differences between developed and developing countries. Nevertheless, most
researchers verified the relationship of subcomponents of taxes or share of
spending for their argument regarding the relationships among tax revenue,
public spending, and economic outcomes. However, these factors do not
represent the full competency of government in operating their fiscal policy or
in implementing financial regulations. To understand the full meaning of a
government’s capability in managing public finance, we should examine total
tax revenue and general government expenditure. At this time, we find little
literature that describes the roles of total tax revenue and total government
expenditure. Performing empirical research to explore the long-run
relationship between public finance and economic growth is future research in
a global economy. However, these authors analyzed the correlation between
tax revenue and government expenditure using disaggregated components that
contribute to general taxes or spending. In addition, the rate of growth of the
economy depends on total production factors. Total tax revenue and general
government expenditure are two of these total production factors. Based on
this argument, only the total tax revenue and general government expenditure
factors, which represent public finance, could fully explain the growing
                                       45



economies. In addition, to understand the capability of government as well as
full efficiency in controlling economic activities, researchers should define the
relationships of total tax revenue, government expenditure, and economic
growth in their model. In recent decades, we found little research that
examined total revenue and total government expenditure data. We can easily
find a large amount of literature that argues about the role of efficiency in
spending by share of expenditure or identify many studies that confirmed the
role of subcomponents of taxes in promoting economic growth. On the one
hand, we found studies that evaluated the complicated relationship between
share of government spending and economic growth, such as Landau (1985),
Grier and Tullock (1989), Barro (1990), Hitiris and Posnett (1992), Aizenman
and Glick (2006), Cooray (2009), Baltagi and Moscone (2010), and Annabi et
al. (2011). Other researchers considered the diverse role of tax structure in the
correlation with economic growth, including Samuelson (1954), Solow
(1956), Koster and Kormendi (1989), Bovenberg and van der Ploeg (1996),
Bassanini and Scarpetta (2002), Lee and Gordon (2005), Arnold (2008),
Mercan et al. (2010), and Ojede and Yamarik (2012). On the other hand, a
small group of scholars has argued that the interactions among tax revenue,
government expenditure, and economic growth differ according to different
groups of countries (Barro, 1991; Engen & Skinner, 1996; Kneller et al., 1999;
Barro & Sala-i-Martin, 2004; Romero- Ávila & Strauch, 2008). Stoilova
(2017) conducted a regression on pooled panel data for EU-28 countries from
1996 to 2013 and found that consumption taxes, income taxes, and property
taxes promote economic growth in EU-28 countries. The limitation of these
studies is the lack of evaluation of total tax revenue and expenditure. This
point poses a challenge to economic researchers for clearly evaluating the role
of full fiscal competence of governments in promoting their economies.

2.4.2. Relationship between tax revenue and government expenditures
                                      46



       Unfortunately, the EC model does not indicate the direction of the
relationship between tax revenue and expenditure. Although most researchers
investigated and confirmed the long-run relationship between tax revenue and
spending, these arguments are complicated and unclear, and a large amount of
literature only verified the role of components of taxes or parts of spending
objectives. Furthermore, most of these previous researchers applied co-
integration and Granger tests to examine the relationship between revenue and
government expenditure. Some scholars supported the fiscal synchronization
hypothesis, which suggests that to control deficits, governments should raise
revenue and cut spending simultaneously (Chang et al., 2002; Chang &
Chiang, 2009; Chowdhury, 2011; Mehrara et al., 2011; Paleologou, 2013.)
Other researchers confirmed that to handle budget deficits, governments
should reduce spending (Chang et al., 2002; Narayan, 2005; Saunoris &
Payne, 2010; Chowdhury, 2011; Dalena & Magazzino, 2012; Paleologou,
2013) depending on different economic statuses. However, Chang et al. (2002)
and Al-Khulaifi (2012) confirmed the tax and spend hypothesis, which
denotes the role of taxes in leading expenditure to maintain more stable
economies.

       In summary, there are three strands of discussions about the
relationship between tax revenue and government expenditure. First, there is
the fiscal synchronization hypothesis that defines the bidirectional causal link
between these two variables (Musgrave, 1966; Meltzer & Richard, 1981;
Bohn, 1991; Chang & Chiang, 2009). Second, the “spend-tax” hypothesis says
that government expenditure can be a key reason for the change in tax revenue
(Friedman, 1978; Darrat, 1998; Blackley, 1986). The last strand is considered
in the “tax-spend” hypothesis that notes the role of tax revenue in enabling the
government to manage expenses (Mahdavi & Westerlund, 2008; Hansan et al.,
2012.) However, most researchers examined the panel data of a single country
or high-income countries and arrived at the main conclusion to justify these
                                      47



three hypotheses. Most of these previous studies used real data of only three
variables: general revenue, expenditure, and GDP. Nevertheless, economic
activities can be modified up or down depending not only on revenue or
expenditure, but also on other macroeconomic variables, including investment,
inflation, trade capability, and quality or quantity of human capital. To bridge
this point, this research adds more macroeconomic variables in the
experimental model and continues the analysis of the influences of the main
variables and control proxies when there is interaction among them.

2.4.3. Influence of governance on public finance and economic growth

       Corruption has different impacts depending on different times and
different places; where it exists and its harmful consequences are complicated
(Cintra et al., 2017.)

       Arguments about the role of corruption in an economy can be separated
into two parts. First, corruption can directly affect economic growth. Second,
corruption boosts or reduces growth through its effect on the efficiency of the
system of tax collection and government spending.

       First, corruption directly affects economic growth. Attila (2009) applied
endogenous growth theory to explain the two opposing effects of corruption
on public revenue and public spending. Corruption can positively affect the
growth rate, but it can exert negative effects on tax revenue. Méon and Weill
(2010) conducted two tests for the hypotheses of corruption of “Grease the
wheels” or “Sand the wheels” for a data set of 69 developing and developed
countries in 3-year period, and found corruption positively affects growth in
inefficient countries. Dzhumashev (2014) calibrated his argument with a data
set of developing countries from 1960 to 2010 and confirmed that corruption
reduces economic growth in low and middle-income countries, while it
enhances growth in economies that are in transition from low to middle
                                     48



income. However, this study does not evaluate the growth impact of tax
revenue and expenditure, which are both input factors of production functions.
These variables are also driven by corruption. Ugur (2014) argued that
corruption represents institutional quality, and has diverse effects on income
per capita of an economy in the long run. To calibrate this argument, he
applied average data over 5 years, which can induce a biased result in the
estimation.

      Second, D’Agostino et al. (2016) applied the endogenous growth model
for 106 developed and developing countries in the period 1996–2010 and
showed that corruption not only directly and positively influences economies
but also indirectly boosts economic outcome depending on the method of
government spending. D’Agostino et al. (2012) estimated the effect of
corruption for 53 developing African countries in 5-year period from 2003 to
2007 and found that corruption directly and indirectly affects government
spending for military investment. In general, it is an obstacle to economic
growth in developing countries. However, it indirectly affects household
utility functions. Bird et al. (2008) conducted 2SLS estimation for an
unbalanced data set of 25 developed and developing countries in two periods,
1998 and 2000, and confirmed that in developing countries, governments
should reduce corruption to increase their tax effort, which can promote
economic growth. Lien (2015) adopted GMM for panel data of 82 developing
countries and found that control of corruption has a positive impact on tax
revenue in low and lower-middle income countries, while this effect is
negative in upper-middle income economies. Aizenman and Glick (2006)
extended the Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1995) model and shed light on the idea
that corruption has an impact on military spending through its impact on taxes
and government spending for non-military. This effect helps government
spending for military boost countries’ income. Acemoglu et al. (1998)
explained the reason corruption promotes economic growth is that corruption
                                       49



is not an efficient allocation system, but it may be created from a re-
distributing process by economic planners. Good governance, therefore,
controls corruption and provides effective expenditure, which reduces child
mortality rates as well as increases primary education, so it promotes
economic growth. Ajaz and Ahmad (2010) adopted GMM for a panel dataset
of 25 developing countries from 1990 to 2005 and argued that control of
corruption is one of the most important factors that affect results of tax
collection. Samimi and Abedini (2012) ran fixed effects and random effects
models for a panel dataset of 40 developing economies in the Middle East and
North African regions and confirmed that corruption is one of the most
harmful factors for economic activities, and that a higher index of control of
corruption leads to low inflation rates of taxes. Aghion et al.(2016) proved that
a lower rate of corruption increases the effective use tax revenue, which can
provides higher welfare and indirectly increase economic outcomes.
Furthermore, the difference in tax revenue between high-income countries and
low-income countries is 10% (Sttauss, 2001; Lien, 2015). Some studies
indicate corruption causes the loss of more than 50% of tax revenue in
developing countries (Richupan, 1984; Alm et al., 1991; Bird, 1990, 1992;
Krugman et al., 1992). Cerqueti and Coppier (2009) proved that in a country
where people feel little shaming effect of corruption being detected in any
transaction, tax revenue grows as the tax rate increases. However, in a country
where people feel shaming effects more strongly, tax revenue increases up to a
threshold value and then moves downward. Brianzoni, Campisi, and Russo
(2017) shed light on the persistence of stable corruption in the long run, which
exhibits complex dynamics of capital per capita. Applying the endogenous
growth model to examine the influences of corruption in government
procurement, these authors indicated that corruption diminishes truth in
government and affects economic growth by decreasing the quality of public
goods.
                                         50



         Most previous researchers applied a production function for the
endogenous growth model to evaluate the relationship between public finance
and economic growth. These authors were also concerned about the effects of
corruption, so they used the theory of quality of governance to explain the role
of corruption in economies, as well as its effect on the linkage between taxes
or spending with economic outcomes.

         Furthermore, D’Agostino et al. (2016) followed the argument of Barro
(1990), Devarajan et al. (1996), and Acemoglu et al. (1998), and designed a
model to estimate the role of corruption in economies as seen as below.

         𝑦 = 𝐴𝑘 1−𝛼−𝛽−𝛿 𝑚𝛼 𝑖 𝛽 𝑐𝑝𝛿 ,                                    (1)

Physical dynamic capital is given by:

𝑘̇ = (1 − 𝜏)𝐴𝑘 1−𝛼−𝛽−𝛿 𝑚𝛼 𝑖 𝛽 𝑐𝑝𝛿 − 𝐶,                                  (2)

where y represents the production function, which is evaluated by the
interaction between private capital k and government expenditure divided into
three parts: spending for military m and investment i and current government
consumption cp . 𝜏 stands for the income tax rate. Based on Barro’s (1990)
argument that government should use the total amount of tax revenue to
provide government spending ( 𝑔̅ ), h1, h2, and h3 indicate the coefficients of
inefficient government distribution though the three components of
government spending. The steady state growth equation presented by
D’Agostino et al. (2016) is seen below:

    𝑐̇     1
𝑦= =           =
    𝑐      𝜎
                                                             𝑔̅
[(1 − 𝛼 − 𝛽 − 𝛿 )(1 − 𝜏)𝐴(ℎ1 𝑔𝑚𝑖𝑙 )𝛼 (ℎ2 𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑣 )𝛽 (ℎ3 𝑔𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠 )𝛿 ( )𝛼+𝛽+𝛿 − 𝑝], (3)
                                                             𝑘
                                       51



The equation (3) does not explain the full meaning of public finance, while the
economic rising depends on a whole tax rate and tax base as well as general
government expenditure.

       In addition, Dzhumashev (2014) argued that public expenditure
depends on effectiveness of governance as well as the level of corruption.
Imam and Jacobs (2007) applied both a control of corruption indicator and
corruption perception index and argued that corruption only affects tax
administration.

       In summary, most previous research investigated the role of corruption
or governance in the short-run or long-run relationship between each part of
public finance, running regressions with a single regression for the secondary
and cross-countries data. In addition, governance and public finance have a
complicated link with economic growth. For the less bias from cross-countries
data, we should apply the appropriate statistic technique. However, almost
previous studies applied the single regression for estimation. To fill in this
gap, this study applied seemingly unrelated regression to determine the role of
governance in modifying the growth effect of total tax revenue and total
expenditure. Zellner (1962) confirmed that for the less bias by using macro
data to estimate with single equation could be fixed with estimation of the
parameters of a set of regression equation as seen as below:

       𝑌𝜇 = 𝑋𝜇 𝛽𝜇 + 𝑈𝜇 , where 𝑌𝜇 is a Tx1 vector of observation on 𝜇′𝑡ℎ
“dependent” variables, 𝑋𝜇 is a Tx𝑙𝜇 matrix with rank of 𝑙𝜇 observation on
𝑙𝜇 ′𝑡ℎ “independent” variables, 𝛽𝜇 is a 𝑙𝜇 x1 vector of regression coefficient and
𝑈𝜇 is a Tx1 vector of random error terms, each with mean zero. This system
may be written as seen as below:
                                      52



        𝑦1     𝑋1 0 … 0 𝛽1     𝑢1
        𝑦2     0 𝑋2 … 0 𝛽2     𝑢 2

         . = . . .         . + .                                      (4)
         .       . . .     .    .
                        [ 𝛽  ]
       [𝑦𝑀 ] [0 0 … 𝑋𝑀 ] 𝑀 [𝑢𝑀 ]
       Which can be re-write as below:
                   𝑀
       𝑣𝑒𝑐 (𝑌) = (⊕ 𝑋𝑖 ) 𝑣𝑒𝑐({𝛽𝑖 }𝑀) + 𝑣𝑒𝑐(𝐸),                        (5)
                   𝑖=1

       where,
𝑌 = (𝑦1 … . 𝑦𝑀 ), 𝐸 = (𝜖1 … 𝜖𝑀 ),⊕𝑀
                                  𝑖=1, 𝑋𝑖 = 𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑔 (𝑋1 … 𝑋𝑀 ), {𝛽𝑖 }𝑀 denotes a

set of M vector and vector (𝑋𝑖 ) is the vector operator that stacks the columns
of a matrix or set vectors. The disturbances, vec ( E ) in (5) have zero mean
and variance-covariance matrix ∑ ⊕ 𝐼𝑇, i.e. vec ( E )  (0, ∑⊕ 𝐼𝑇), where

(BLUE) of {𝛽𝑖 } can be obtained by solving the generalized linear least squares
problems.

2.5 Designing the analytical framework and building hypotheses

       First, after making the critical literature review of relationship among
tax revenue, government expenditure, and economic growth, this research
finds the complicated linkage of public finance, which was measured by total
tax revenue and general government expenditure and growth of economy.
Until now, the long run relationship among these variables are complicated
and need to be clarified. In addition, both public choice and cost-benefit
theories pose a challenge to researchers for investigating the relationship
among total tax revenue, government expenditure, and economic growth. Last,
previous empirical researchers mentioned that between public finance and
                                        53



economic growth exists the complicated relationship and need to be clarified.
These points lead this thesis to develop the first, hypothesis.

       The first hypothesis (1): There is a long run correlation between public
finance and economic growth.

       Second, World Bank (2017) noted that to gain high income,
government should try to keep their economy to be more stable. Additionally,
deficit is a factor that leads the status of economy. Nevertheless, to helps
government well control deficit, the hypotheses of “tax-spend, spend and tax”
can be a basic argurement supporting accademic rsearchers to identify the
direction of linkage between tax revenue and government expenditure.
Additionally, tax and spend theory, which argures the three hypotheses (see
point 2.4.2) for handling deficit and creating government budget in both
developed and developing countries. As my mentioned argument, public
choice theory showed two types of government, who concerns the trade-off
theory or not. Until now public choice theory does not clearly confirm that
what kind of government operate their economy better. That is why this
argument needs to be clarified. These points lead this thesis to develop the
second hypothesis.

       The second hypothesis (2): Tax revenue and government expenditure
cause each other.

       Third, the corruption and governance theory confirmed that quality of
governance and corruption play a crucial role in an economy. Corruption is a
difficult definition and need to be explored. As you may know that both
corruption and governance theory and endogenous growth theory pose the
challenge of evaluation the capability of governance as well as investigation of
linakge between governance and economic growth. Furthermore, corruption
represents the quality of governance, total tax revenue and total government
                                      54



expenditure can reveal the capacity of government. Therefore, much of
empirical studies tried to examine the role of corruption in an economy.
However, these studies explained the way corruption affect economy through
activites of tax payers, housheholds, or government officials that represent
partilly the society and economy. Rarely, to see the research, which verifies
the quality and quantity capability of governance in leading economy.

       In addition, summary of literature saying about verifying the role of
corruption in modifying influences among tax revenue, governemnt
expenditure and economic growth, shed light on the corruption theory, which
posed the “greasing and salting wheels” of corruption in an economy.

       Furthermore, corruption theory with “greasing and salting wheels” of
economy confirms that corruption diversely affects economies depending on
different group of countries, different times and places, where it appears. In
last decades, debates over influence of corruption becomes ambigious.

       Lastly, endogenous growth theory alway is a mixed issue, which
attracts more literature. That’s why, this research following three above
theories to develop third research hypothesis.

       The third hypothesis (3): Governance modifies the effects of public
finance on economic growth differently according to different group countries.

       From these above hypotheses, this thesis develops the research
analytical framework as seen as below.

      Figure 2.2 shows that the control of corruption indicator denotes the
governance and logarithm of GDP per capita represents the economic growth
of a country. Furthermore, this figure also indicates the beneficial role of
governance in an economy. Additionally, when governance interacts with any
part of public finance, the effect of these interactions on growth may be
changed. Through this figure, we can see the bi-directional causal link
between tax revenue and government spending.

2.6. Summary

      First, performing the literature review helped establish a sense of the
long-run relationship among public finance and economic growth. In addition,
study regarding the relationship between tax revenue and government
expenditure began in the nineteenth century. This linkage becomes more
complicated because of the different theories about how the relationship
between tax revenue and expenditure is determined. Furthermore, most
scholars have applied one of four hypotheses to examine the linkages between
these variables: the fiscal synchronization, “spend and tax”, “tax and spend”,
and neutral situational hypotheses. These hypotheses could provide the
orientation and guidance to support policymakers in handling deficits and
issuing appropriate legal regulations related to collecting taxes, as well as
spending for public society. Leading economic activities not only depend on
public finance factors, but also depend on governance or other macroeconomic
factors. These include the inflation rate, which indicates the stability of the
economy; the percent of inflow of foreign direct investment per GDP, which
represents the investment climate; or human capital (human development
index), which represents the endogenous phenomenon of an economy that
needs to be fixed. However, this study is based on public choice theory and
cost-benefit of taxation theory to clarify the relationship between public
finance and economic growth, verifying the endogenous phenomenon in an
economy.

      Second, critically reviewing previous literature provides evidence of
the crucial role of governance in explaining the differences between developed
and developing countries, through the hypothesis of “greasing and salting the
wheels” of corruption in an economy. These previous findings suggest that
government should focus on the control of corruption and react depending on
the different outcomes of the economy. Furthermore, most previous research
                                      57



has estimated the direct impact of corruption on economic growth, therefore,
this research verifies the direct and indirect role of governance affecting the
economic growth through its interaction with public finance.

      Finally, a summary of endogenous growth theory helped in
understanding and properly choosing the appropriate analytical estimation to
reduce bias from an endogenous phenomenon.

                                 CHAPTER 3
                   METHODS AND RESEARCH DATA


3.1 Introduction

      This chapter sheds light on the adopting methodology to design the
study for dissertation. The first section explicates the applied research
philosophy and research model to collect secondary data. The second section
introduces research approach that says about appropriate methods, applied
theories and research design. The last section admits the summary of research
philosophy, data, and methods.

3.2. Research models

3.2.1 Long-term linkages between public finance, and economic growth

      Landau (1985) shed light on that real GDP per capita depends on total
government expenditure; he also argued that cost of deflation, consumption
and investment may impact on expenditure.

      Barro (1990) assumed that government expenditure is financed by
income tax rate:

                       𝑔
𝑔 = 𝑇 = 𝜏𝑦 = 𝜏. 𝑘. ∅ ( ),                                          (1)
                       𝑘

where g is government expenditure, T is government revenue, 𝜏 is income tax
rate, it also affects capital resource, 𝑦 denotes economic outcome. We can
resume Barro’s argument is that both government expenditure and revenue are
equal total tax revenue and depend on capital resource. The limitation of
Barro’s study is a simple tax. Romero-Ávila and Strauch (2008) expanded this
model with lum-sum taxation, tax rate T, productive government expenditure g
and other governemnt expenditure G as seen as below:
                                         59



  𝑔 + 𝐺 = 𝜏. 𝑦 + 𝑇,                                                   (2)

       Barro (1991) measured economic growth by annual growth rate of GDP
per capita. He discussed that human capital can affect economic growth by
two ways such as: values of school-enrollment rates at the secondary and
primary levels.

       Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1992), based on arguments in Arrow (1962)
and Rome (1986), state that production per worker not only depends on own
capital per worker k, it also depends on the spillover of knowledge or ideas
from worker 𝑘̅ , so the production function may be rewritten as:

                     ̅̅̅𝛼
       𝑦 = 𝐴. 𝑘 1−𝛼 (𝑘)            0 < 𝛼 < 1,                         (3)
In addition, these authors followed Samuelson (1954) and revealed that total
government purchase G can affect production function, so economic outcome
can be explained by below equation:
𝑦 = 𝐴. 𝑘 1−𝛼 𝐺 𝛼 ,                                                    (4)
From (3) and (4) the authors designed the model to evaluate economic growth
as seen as below:
𝑦 = 𝐴. 𝑘. (𝐺/𝐾)𝛼 ,                                                    (5)
Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1992) showed that the long-run growth rate in this
model ∅ can be expressed as:
                        1⁄
∅ = (1 − 𝜏)(1 − 𝛼)𝐴      (1−𝛼) (𝑔/𝑦)𝛼/(1−𝛼)   − 𝜇,                   (6)

where  and 𝜇 are constants that reflect parameters in the utility function, the
growth rate is decreasing in the rate of distortionary taxes 𝜏, increasing in
government productive expenditure g.

       Mankiw, Romer and Weil (1992) defined the way to explain economic
growth with following equation:

𝑦(𝑡) = 𝐾 (𝑡 )𝛼 𝐻(𝑡)𝛽 (𝐴(𝑡 )𝐿(𝑡 ))1−𝛼−𝛽          0 < 𝛼 < 1, 𝛼 + 𝛽 < 1,       (7)
                                                60



where 𝑦(𝑡) is economic outcome at time t, K(t) is physical capital, H(t) is
stock of human capita, and L(t) is labor force. However, A(t)L(t) never stays,
they assumed that the growth rate of A(t)L(t) is (n+g), depreciation of capital
source is 𝛿, 𝑠𝑘 is faction of income invested in physical capita and 𝑠ℎ is
faction invested in human capital, so they designed the equation for
assessment of steady state of income per capita as seen as below:

      𝑌(𝑡)                          𝛼+𝛽                𝛼            𝛽
𝑙𝑛 [𝐿(𝑡)] = 𝑙𝑛𝐴(0) + 𝑔𝑡 − 1−𝛼−𝛽 ln(𝑛 + 𝑔 + 𝛿) + 1−𝛼−𝛽 ln(𝑠𝑘 ) + 1−𝛼−𝛽 ln(𝑠ℎ ), (8)


             Aparicio, Urbano and Audretsch (2016) applied production function to
determine economic growth as following equation:

𝑌𝑖𝑡              𝛽   𝛽    𝛽     𝛽     𝛽
      = 𝛼𝑂𝐸𝑖𝑡1 𝐾𝑖𝑡2 𝑋𝑖𝑡3 𝐿𝐸𝑖𝑡4 𝐺𝐶𝑖𝑡5 ,                                              (9)
𝐿𝑖𝑡


where 𝑌𝑖𝑡 is the economic output of a country i at time t, measured as the gross
                                                                        𝑌𝑖𝑡
domestic product (GDP); 𝐿𝑖𝑡 denotes the total labor force (hence              represents
                                                                        𝐿𝑖𝑡

labor productivity, a proxy for economic growth); OEit denotes its endowment
of opportunity entrepreneurship; Kit is country i's endowment of capital, Xit is
exports, LEit represents the life expectancy and GCit is the final government
consumption.
             However, 𝑂𝐸𝑖𝑡 = 𝑓 (𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑡 , 𝐹𝐼𝑖𝑡 , 𝑥𝑖𝑡 ),                            (10)

where IIit and FIit are vectors representing the informal and formal factors such
as control of corruption, respectively, and xit is the controlling vector that
influences opportunity for entrepreneurship in country i at time t.

             Through this paragraph, we know that almost previous researchers
applied Cobb-Doulags’ production function and expanded by adding other
control variables. These authors may be divided into two major strands. The
first group includes researchers, who supported neo-classical or exogenous
growth model and conducted the simple OLS, GLS models to estimate the
                                              61



growth effects. The second group that supported endogenous growth model
and performed the FE, 2SLS, GMM model. However, almost these researchers
convinced the role of human capita or physical capita or government
consumption. There are little researchers evaluated the role of public finance
in a growth model. Furthermore, public finance affects production inputs and
tax revenue has influences on investment climate of countries so that we
should investigate the link between total tax revenue, general government
expenditure and economic growth in long run.

3.2. 2 Tax revenue and expenditure relationship

         As we may know that, ECM model as seen below, represents the long-
run relationship between public finance and economic growth.

      Hendry and Richard (1982), Kremer et al. (1992), and Banerjee et al.
(1996, 1998) developed the ECM model to verify the linkage between tax
revenue and expenditure:
      ∆𝑌𝑡 = 𝛼 ′ ∆𝑋𝑡 + 𝛽 (𝑌𝑡−1 ′ 𝑋𝑡−1 ) + 𝜖𝑡 ,                 (11)
         ∆𝑋𝑡 = 𝑢𝑡                t = 1,…..T                             (12)
         Kao and Chiang (2000) Expanded the panel equation as following:
                 ′        ′
         𝑦𝑖,𝑡 = 𝑥𝑖,𝑡 𝛽 + 𝑧𝑖,𝑡 𝛾 + 𝑢𝑖,𝑡,                                 (13)

         where {𝑦𝑖,𝑡 } are 1x1, 𝛽 is a k x1 vector of the slope parameters, zi,t is
the deterministic component and {𝑢𝑖,𝑡 } are the stationary disturbance terms,
{𝑥𝑖,𝑡 } are k x1 intergrated process of order one for all i, where 𝑥𝑖,𝑡 = 𝑥𝑖,𝑡−1 +
𝜖𝑖,𝑡 ,

         However, to maintain a stable economy, government must control
deficits depending on tax and spending, so some authors have run Granger
tests for panel data to identify the relationship between tax revenue and
government expenditure. The argument about the correlation between tax
revenue and public expenditure based on the three following points of view.
                                      62



First, the fiscal synchronization hypothesis confirms the bidirectional causal
link between the two variables (Musgrave, 1966; Meltzer & Richard, 1981;
Bohn, 1991; Chang & Chiang, 2009). Chang and Chiang (2009) applied a unit
root test following Phillips and Perron (1988). They then conducted a co-
integration test, which was also run by Kao (1999), and finally, they adopted
the Granger causality test for 15 OECD countries in a 15-year period (1992–
2006). Their results supported the fiscal synchronization hypothesis, which
argues that policy makers should make decisions relating to revenue and
expenditure jointly. Mehrara et al. (2011) conducted the same tests for a
dataset of 40 Asian countries over a 14-year period (1995 to 2008), and also
supported the fiscal synchronization hypothesis.

      Second, the “spend-tax” hypothesis, which maintains that the
government expenditure can be a root cause of change in tax revenue
(Friedman, 1978; Darrat, 1998; Blackley, 1986). Saunoris & Payne 2010
performed the same above test for UK data in 55-year period (1955–2009) and
their finding supports the spend–tax hypothesis with asymmetric adjustment
in long run equilibrium relationship between government revenues and
expenditures.

      The last strand is reflected through the “tax-spend” hypothesis that
considers the role of tax revenue in enabling a government to guide expenses
(Mahdavi & Westerlund, 2008; Hansan et al., 2012). Al-Khulaifi (2012) also
adopted the unit root, co-integration, and Granger tests for data from Qatar in
a 32-year period (1980–2011).

      Chang et al. (2002), Narayan (2005), Dalena & Magazzino (2012),
Chowdhury (2011), and Paleologou (2013) also used these three tests and
confirmed the mix hypothesis. However, most studies used these three tests to
examine panel or cross-sectional data from high-income countries or of a
single country. Most studies arrived at main conclusions that justified one of
                                           63



the three hypotheses. For supporting the policymakers in both developed and
developing countries, the questions raising here as to whether there a
bidirectional causality link exists between tax revenue and expenditure.

3.2.3. Relationship among governance, tax revenue, government expenditure,
and economic growth

       Acemoglu et al. (2003) tried to explain the different outcome between
high income countries and low income countries by adding institution variable
in their model:

            ′                          ′
𝑋𝑐,𝑡−1,𝑡 = 𝑄𝑐,𝑡−1,𝑡 . 𝛼 + 𝛽. 𝐼𝑐,𝑡=0 + 𝑍𝑐,𝑡−1,𝑡 . 𝛾 + 𝜃. 𝑙𝑛𝑦𝑐,𝑡−1 + 𝜖𝑐,𝑡−1,𝑡 ,     (14)

where 𝑋𝑐,𝑡−1,𝑡 says about macroeconomic outcome for country c between
                                                                       ′
times t and t-1, the outcome measured by deviation of GDP per capita. 𝑄𝑐,𝑡−1,𝑡
indicates a vector of macroeconomic policies for country c between times t
                                                                         ′
and t-1, 𝐼𝑐,𝑡=0 denotes the institution of the beginning of the sample, 𝑍𝑐,𝑡−1,𝑡 is
control variables, 𝑙𝑛𝑦𝑐,𝑡−1 is logarithm of initial income per capita.

       Bird, Martinez-Vazquez and Torgler (2008) designed the equation for
evaluating level effect of corruption on tax effort as following equation.

𝑇𝐸𝑖 = 𝛼 + 𝛽1 𝑌𝑖 + 𝛽2 𝑃𝑂𝑃𝑖 + 𝛽3 𝑋𝑀𝑖 + 𝛽4 𝑁𝐴𝐺𝑅𝑖 + 𝛽5 𝐺𝑂𝑉𝑄𝑖 + 𝑅𝐸𝐺𝐼𝑂𝑁𝑖 +
𝜀𝑖,                                                                             (15)

where i is a country i, 𝑇𝐸𝑖 says the tax effort of country i, Yi denotes the GDP
per capita, POPi is population growth, XMi is ratio between export and import,
NAGRi presents the non-agricultural products, GOVQi stands for indicator of
corruption and accountbility of country i.

       Furthermore, Cooray (2009) shed light on role of quality of governance
for interpretation of economic gorwth, he followed and expanded the Mankiw,
Romer and Weil (1992) as following:
                                       64



       𝑦(𝑡 ) = 𝐴𝑘(𝑡)𝛼 ℎ(𝑡)𝛽 (𝑔(𝑡 )𝑒𝜇𝜃 )𝛾 ,                          (16)

where y(t) stands for output per worker; k(t) denotes the stock of private
capital per worker; and h(t) says about the stock of human capital per worker.
The size dimension of the government, g(t), is measured by the stock of
government capital per worker, and 𝜃 measures the quality dimension of the
government.

       Beekman, Bulte and Nillesen (2013) argued that corruption affects
economic behavious according to following equation:

       𝐸𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑜𝑚𝑖𝑐 𝑏𝑒ℎ𝑎𝑣𝑖𝑜𝑢𝑠𝑖𝑗 = 𝛼 + 𝛽𝑘 + 𝛽1 𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑢𝑝𝑡𝑗 + 𝛽2 𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑗 +
𝛽3 𝑋𝑖𝑗 + 𝜀𝑖𝑗,                                                       (17)

where subscript I indexes household I =1,….N and subscript j indexes
community j =1,…44, 𝛽1 stands for coefficient of interest, and 𝛽𝑘 denotes the
fixed effect of province with k=1,2, and 3.

3.3 Research data and its source

3.3.1. Determining appropriate variables and its sources

       “Before choosing data, this study seeks to select the appropriate
variables for designing the research models. This study measures the public
finance variable by two subcomponents. First, the ratio between total tax
revenue and GDP represents the “TAXgdp” variable. Second, “GEXgdp”
stands for a variable of the rate of total government expenditure to GDP.
These two variables denote the public finance in this research and we collect
the data of these two variables from the IMF’s database - Government finance
statistic (GFS). Following d'Agostino et al. (2016), Acemoglu et al. (2003),
Acemoglu et al. (2008), Johansson et al., 2008, and Kneller et al. (1999), as
well as a few other previous researchers, we evaluate economic growth using
                                        65



GDP per capita (measured in constant US dollars using 2010 as the base year).
GDP per capita helps us get more robust results than GDP or average growth
rate of GDP per capita. GDP per capita is gross domestic product divided by
midyear population. The World Bank considered that GDP is the sum of gross
value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes
and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. This
calculation of GDP is without making deductions for depreciation of
fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. Data
are in constant 2010 U.S. dollars.”

       To get the third research objective, a “control of corruption” score
obtained from Kaufman et al. (2011) measures the “governance” variable
(CCI). This variable measures perceptions of corruption, conventionally
defined as the exercise of public power for private gain. The scores are
oriented so that higher values correspond to better outcomes, on a scale from –
2.5 to 2.5. A higher index indicates lower corruption or lack of corruption and
higher control of corruption. This study collected this data from the World
Bank’s database - World Governance Indicators (WGI). Since 2002, this
examination has taken place annually; therefore, the data from 1997, 1999,
and 2001 in this study were added up and divided to get the average value
(See Torgler and Schneider, 2009; Law et al., 2013.) This variable may
support taxes system as well as public spending. For robustness check, we
continue to extract the corruption perception index (CPI) of business, which
was evaluated by Transparency International (TI) from 1996 to 2011, they
computed the maximum index is ten, however, from 2012, this CPI was
changed the computation method, and the highest index is 100, which
represents the area, where corruption is free. Almost developing countries
lacked the index in 1996 and 1997. This study assumes that the beginning
score of this index is the same score in 1998, so this research chooses the
nearest index to fill in this missing value for these two years.
                                     66



      Furthermore, we extract the annual data for whole sample, which
includes 38 developed and 44 developing countries over a 21-year period
(1996-2016.) (See Appendix A1- List of studied countries).

      Due to the reason of that, instability of economies affects economic
activities so that we choose inflation annual index (INFL) for saying about
economic status. In this research, FDI’s rate to GDP denotes the investment
climate (FDI). This study collects this data from the World Bank’s database –
World Development Indicators (WDI).

      The human development index is a variable that indicates the quality of
human capital in a society. We collect the human development index (HDI)
from the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) (see table 3.1).

       Since the positivism philosophy is suitable for large amounts of
numeric data, this study collects the secondary data from the World Bank’s
database, International Monetary Fund (IMF)’s database and UNDP’s
database. Secondary data is more convenient to use, and is credible because it
has been checked by previous researchers, or by carefully using the factors for
analysis.

3.3.2 Collecting secondary data

     The topic of public finance, governance, and economic growth is a social
topic that debates and conducts an experiment to examine the linkage between
tax revenue and expenditure, as well as the role of public finance and
governance in both developed and developing economies.

     Commonly, to resolve a research topic, the researcher should review the
theories that provide the core analytical framework or arguments supporting
the author’s hypotheses. In addition, a researcher should offer his or her
viewpoint to evaluate the change in tax revenue or expenditure when
governments change their current policies, or issues any new laws or
regulations related to these variables, such as tax revenue and government
expenditure.

     Second, to convince readers to be interested in the topic with readers’
strong beliefs as well as to avoid bias from subjective ideas, the researcher
should collect a large data set from developed and developing countries; then
he or she should conduct an experimental study to provide proof of his or her
above-mentioned theories.

       Creswell (2009) indicated that researchers always begin the scientific
method with theory, then collect data that supports or refutes their theory, and
make any necessary revisions before adding a test. The data are collected on
                                        68



an instrument that measures attitudes, and the information is analyzed using
statistical procedures and hypothesis testing. The quantitative methos is the
best approach to performe the test a theory or explanation, therefore, this
research collects the secondary data from three major sources mentioned in
3.3.1.

3. 4 Check balance and essential test

         Based on characteristic of large, longitudinal, and cross-sectional panel
data, this study has to check balance of data via statistical software due to that
imbalanced data is more harmful to general performance. It also poses a big
challenge for statistics to ensure the robustness (Wang and Yao, 2012). In
addition, to answer the research question 1, and 2, this study needs to verify
the stationary of research variables for justification of that Granger test, long-
run test and any regression those are appropriate to the dynamic panel data.
Regarding the panel data, this study makes aware of that non-stationary
variables may lead to the spurious correlations and presenting the unreliable
and invalid empirical results.

         This thesis employs the unit root test following Harris-Tzavalis (HT)
(1999) test and Im-Pesaran-Shin (IPS) (2003), owing to the reason that Im-
Pesaran-Shin (IPS) (2003) relaxes the assumption of a common rho and does
not require a strong balanced panel for the less bias from spurious regression
as well as co-integration test running. While the Harris-Tzavalis (HT) (1999)
test hypothesizes, which assumes that all panels have the same autoregressive
parameter and rho is smaller than 1 and the periods are fixed. However, the
IPS test does not necessitate balanced data but requires that T must be at least
5 if the dataset is strongly balanced for the asymptotic normal distribution of Z
- t-tilde-bar to hold.

3. 5 Choose appropriate analytical methods
                                           69



       Holley (2011) confirmed that short-term tax changes can be different
from long-run effects because of the great elasticity of the demand curve. In
past decades, some previous researchers have performed a comprehensive
analysis of this difference to help policymakers design appropriate fiscal
policies. Since it helps avoid the bias given the case of regressions from non-
stationary variables, multiple studies employed co-integration test to clear up
the problem of spurious regression (e.g. McCoskey & Kao, 1999; Bai & Ng.,
2004; Pedroni, 2004; Breitung & Pesaran, 2005; Westerlund & Edgerton,
2008; Persyn & Westerlund, 2008).

       First, to answer the first research question, this study conduct co-
integration test due to following reasons that the error-correction (EC) model
is often applied to investigate the long-run relationship between stationary as
well as cointegrated variables (Ojede & Yamarik, 2012). “The Westerlund
error-correction based panel cointegration tests are very flexible and allow for
an almost completely heterogeneous specification of both the long- and short-
run parts of the error-correction model, where the latter can be determined
from the data. The series are allowed to be of unequal length. If the cross-
sectional units are suspected of being correlated, robust critical values can be
obtained through bootstrapping..”

       Assuming that i represents a country and t is time period, the long-run
relationship can be represented as below:

𝑙𝑟𝑔𝑑𝑝𝑖,𝑡 = 𝛼0,𝑖 + 𝛼𝑖,𝑡 𝑃𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛽𝑖,𝑡 𝐺𝑜𝑣𝑖,𝑡 + 𝑢𝑖,𝑡 ,                    (1)

where 𝑙𝑟𝑔𝑑𝑝𝑖,𝑡 is logarithm of real GDP per capita (dependent variable), 𝛼0,𝑖
                                       ′
is a country-specific intercept term, 𝛼𝑖,𝑡 denotes country-characteristic slope
coefficients, 𝑃𝑖,𝑡 and 𝐺𝑜𝑣𝑖,𝑡 indicate the vectors of public finance and
governance, and 𝑢𝑖,𝑡 is an error term of country i at time t.
                                         70



         “By using public finance, which was measured by the rate of total tax
revenue to GDP and the ration between general government expenditure and
GDP in the equation (1), this study provides the better evidence of the
relationship between public finance and economic growth than previous
studies. First, the government collects total tax revenue following the tax base
and tax rate. If the government change any tax rate or tax base this decision
may change any behavior of the private investors who may lead the economic
growth. Second, the government expenditure supports the input of production
function such as labor force, infrastructure or safety society. Using public
finance helps policymakers better to understand the whole situation of an
economy than explore each kind of taxes or each share of the public spending.

         In case a co-integration linkage exists between 𝑙𝑟𝑔𝑑𝑝𝑖,𝑡 , 𝑃𝑖,𝑡 and
𝐺𝑜𝑣𝑖,𝑡 variables, and error term 𝑢𝑖,𝑡 is an I(0) process for all countries i, we can
re-write the growth equation in terms of an autoregressive distributed lag
(ARDL) of order (p, q) as below:

𝑙𝑟𝑔𝑑𝑝𝑖,𝑡 = 𝛽1,𝑖 𝑙𝑟𝑔𝑑𝑝𝑖,𝑡−1 + 𝛽2,𝑖 𝑙𝑟𝑔𝑑𝑝𝑖,𝑡−2 + ⋯ + 𝛽𝑝,𝑠 𝑙𝑟𝑔𝑑𝑝𝑖,𝑡−𝑝 + 𝜎𝑜,𝑖 𝑃𝑖,𝑡 +
𝜎1,𝑖 𝑃𝑖,𝑡−1 + ⋯ + 𝜎𝑞,𝑖 𝑃𝑖,𝑡−𝑞 +𝛾𝑜,𝑖 𝐺𝑜𝑣𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛾1,𝑖 𝐺𝑜𝑣𝑖,𝑡−1 + ⋯ + 𝛾𝑞,𝑖 𝐺𝑜𝑣𝑖,𝑡−𝑞 +
𝜀𝑖 + 𝜗𝑖,𝑡 ,                                                               (1.1)

where p is number of lag of dependent variable, and q is number of lag of
independent variables.

Then, we re-design the error-correction model as follows:

                     𝑝−1                 𝑞−1
∆𝑙𝑟𝑔𝑑𝑝𝑖,𝑡 = ∑𝑗=1 𝛽𝑗,𝑖 ∆𝑙𝑟𝑔𝑑𝑝𝑖,𝑡−𝑗 + ∑𝑗=0 𝜎𝑗,𝑡 ∆𝑃𝑖,𝑡−𝑗 + 𝜇𝑖 [𝑙𝑟𝑔𝑑𝑝𝑖,𝑡−1 − 𝜃0,𝑖 −

𝜃1,𝑖 𝑃𝑖,𝑡 ] + 𝜗𝑖,𝑡                                                        (1.2)

                     𝑝−1                 𝑞−1
∆𝑙𝑟𝑔𝑑𝑝𝑖,𝑡 = ∑𝑗=1 𝛽𝑗,𝑖 ∆𝑙𝑟𝑔𝑑𝑝𝑖,𝑡−𝑗 + ∑𝑗=0 𝛾𝑖,𝑡 ∆𝐺𝑜𝑣𝑖,𝑡−𝑗 + 𝜋𝑖 [𝑙𝑟𝑔𝑑𝑝𝑖,𝑡−1 −

𝛿0,𝑖 − 𝛿1,𝑖 𝐺𝑜𝑣𝑖,𝑡 ] + 𝜗𝑖,𝑡                                               (1.3)
                                          71



where 𝛽𝑗,𝑖 𝛾𝑗,𝑡 and 𝜎𝑗,𝑡 are short-run coefficients, 𝜃0,𝑖 , 𝜃1,𝑖 , 𝛿0,𝑖 and 𝛿1,𝑖 stand
for long-run coefficients, and 𝜇𝑖 and 𝜋𝑖 represent an adjustment-speed (error-
correction term) to the long-run equilibrium.

       “For co-integration test, this study follows Persyn & Westerlund’s
(2008) proposed technique, developed by Westerlund (2007). This allows for a
complete check of heterogeneous characteristics of long-run parts of error
correction model. The null hypothesis is H0: ai = 0 for all i, (i= 1,…N) and
H1: : ai < 0 for all I, (i= 1,…N). The error correction model is as follows:

       𝐷. 𝑦𝑖𝑡 = 𝑐𝑖 + 𝑎𝑖1 ∗ 𝐷. 𝑦𝑖𝑡−1 + 𝑎𝑖2 ∗ 𝐷. 𝑦𝑖𝑡−2 + ⋯ + 𝑎𝑖𝑝 ∗ 𝐷. 𝑦𝑖𝑡−𝑝

                      + 𝑏𝑖0 ∗ 𝐷. 𝑥𝑖𝑡 + 𝑏𝑖1 ∗ 𝐷. 𝑥𝑖𝑡−1 + ⋯ + 𝑏𝑖𝑝 ∗ 𝐷. 𝑥𝑖𝑡−𝑝

                       + 𝑎𝑖 (𝑦𝑖𝑡−1 − 𝑏𝑖 ∗ 𝑥𝑖𝑡−1 ) + 𝑢𝑖𝑡 ”

       This test uses the 𝐺𝑎 and Gt test statistics to check the null hypothesis
for at least one i. These statistics start from a weighted average of the
individually estimated Ga to measure 𝑎𝑖′ s and Gt measuring their t-ratio's,
respectively. The test also requires the null hypothesis (H0) be rejected for
accumulating evidence of co-integration of at least one of the cross-sectional
units. The Pa and Pt test statistics pool information over all the cross-sectional
units to test H0: ai = 0 for all i, (i= 1,…N) and H1: : ai < 0 for all I, (i= 1,…N).
Rejection of H0 is thus substantial to validate an existence of co-integration
given the entire the panel..”

       By showing the persistence of the relationship between public finance
and economic growth, this study becomes a little research, which verified the
relationship between public finance and economic growth in the long run.
Almost previous studies checked the relationship between each type of tax rate
or tax base or share of expenditure with corruption or economic growth only.
                                          72



       As we may know that, the co-integration test does not affirm the
direction of causal linkage; therefore, this study runs the Granger (1969) test
to identify the direction of linkage between tax revenue and government
expenditure and sets out to identify whether there exists the one way
directional linkage or bi-directional linkage between economic growth and
public finance. The results of the Granger test could help this study to answer
the second research question. Furthermore, Maziarz (2015) confirmed that
scholar should apply Granger test when theory on connecting mechanism of
two-time series does not exist or it is insufficient. He also conducted this test
when he does not consider the prior theoretical knowledge. The results could
suggest a way to control deficit in both developed and developing countries
based on the relationship between taxation and expenditure arguments.
Additionally, identifying the direction of the relationship between tax revenue
and expenditure also helps this study to enrich the hypothesis of fiscal
synchronization.

       The null hypothesis can be formulated as follows:

                   (𝑘)
             𝐻0 : 𝛽𝑖     = 𝛽(𝑘) ∀𝑖=1,……𝑁 , ∀𝑘=1,….,𝑝
                   (𝑘)       (𝑘)
             𝐻1 : 𝛽𝑖     ≠ 𝛽𝑗 , 𝑘 ∈ {1, … . , 𝑝}, ∃(𝑖, 𝑗) ∈ {1, … . , 𝑁 }
             The corresponding F test is:
                   (SRR 𝑘 − 𝑆𝑅𝑅1 )/𝑝(𝑁 − 1)
             𝑍=
                  SRR1 /[𝑁𝑇 − 𝑁(1 + 𝑝) − 𝑝]

𝜀𝑖 stands for country -characteristic effects and 𝜗𝑖,𝑡 represents the observation
error with E(𝜗𝑖,𝑡 ) = 0.

       In the last decades, a few studies investigated the linkage between
economic growth and public spending or tax revenue that are two
representative factors of public policy. Furthermore, confusing based on Barro
(1990)’s argument that tax revenue is equal to public expenditure,
nevertheless, tax revenue also depends on public expenses. The question is
that “how does tax revenue correlate to government expenditure?” In the past,
the answers have been mixed and confusing. Applying Granger causality test
not only helps this study identify the direction of this relationship, but also to
enrich the hypothesis of fiscal synchronization that supports the research to
capture solution for the second research question.

       However, before running co-integration test, we should ensure that all
variables are stationary that is a reason for doing unit root test first.

       After identifying the co-integration and directions of the linkages
between dependent and independent variables, to answer the third question,
                                      74



this paper conducts a regression for SUR model (Zellner, 1962, and Yanev and
Kontoghiorghes, 2007). This model also verifies the role of governance in
modifying the effects between public finance and economic growth in long-
run. The SUR model can ensure the efficient computation with orthogonal
regression (See equation (4) in chapter 2) and it can help this study to reduce
bias from cross-countries data extracted from two financial crises.

       In this research, M stands for 3 equations, and 𝜇’th dependent variables
are 3 factors such as “tax revenue”, “government spending” and “economic
growth”. The 𝑙𝜇 independent variables are “governance, inflation, FDI, and the
human development index”

       The empirical model and equation for performing SUR model should
be designed as seen as below:

       where 𝑦𝑖,𝑗𝑡 are dependent variables, which stand for economic growth
(lrgdp), tax revenue (TAXgdp), and government expenditure (GEXgdp) of
country i at time t, while 𝑋𝑖,𝑗𝑡 represent the independent variable “Governance
- Gov” and other control variables such as inflation rate (infl), the ratio of
foreign direct investment value per GDP (FDI), and human development
indext (hdi).

       Conducting SUR and SGMM models helps this study to answer the
research question 3 and to fix the endogeneity issue. Blundell and Bond
                                      75



(1998) showed that when the series are closed to a random walk, the system
GMM estimation is more robust. In addition, the outcome of economies could
be affected by dependent variables with first lag, that indicating the
endogenous phenomena. Moreover, the auto-correlation with error term can be
existed. In each equation, 𝜖𝑖𝑡 can re-write as below: 𝜖𝑖𝑡 = 𝑉𝑖 + 𝑈𝑖𝑡 and

term (𝑈𝑖𝑡 − 𝑈
So to solve the endogenous phenomena and auto-correlation, the study has to
apply two-step system generalized method of moments estimation (Hsiao
2003 and Baltagi 2005). Arrellano and Bond (1991), Baltagi (2005),
D’Agostino, Dunne, and Pieroni (2012), and Sasaki (2015) indicated that a
dynamic panel data technique with SGMM can help the endogenous growth
model be more consistent than the fixed effect model. Furthermore, Barro
(1990), Acemoglu and Robinson (2001) revealed that endogenous variables
always appear in growth models that make OLS regression biased, and using
an exogenous instrument could help regressors fix this issue. In addition,
Windmeijer (2005) noted that the two-step GMM procedure obtains consistent
and efficient parameters of estimation.

       Before designing the empirical research models, this work defines the
measurement of economic growth and using other control variables. There is a
large debate of literature on measuring economic growth. In this work, we
follow the definition of economic growth at countries’ level only. Represents
for neoclassical economists, Solow (1956) took the ratio of production (Y t)
stands for growth with the equation: Y(t) = A(t) F(K,L). Stiglitz (1989)
indicated the economy growth if rising rate of income. Barro (1991), Cooray
(2009) calculated the economic growth is a change of GDP per capita at time t
to compare with the previous time, this parameter can explain the real of
changing economy. The equation representing the growth rate per capita was
expressed as:
                                       76



𝑙𝑛𝑦(𝑡 ) − 𝑙𝑛𝑦(0) = (1 − 𝑒 −𝑡 )[𝑙𝑛(𝑦 ∗ ) − ln 𝑦(0)]                   (5)

where y(0) is initial level of output per worker, and y* is stead state level of
income per capita and  is speed of convergence and  = (1 -  -  - )(+ 
+). Mankiw et al. (1992), Barro & Sala-i-Martin (1992), Acemoglu et al.
(2005), Acemoglu et al. (2008) used GDP per capita to measure the economic
growth. While Siddiqui & Ahmed (2013) considered the rate of growth of real
GDP per capita is economic growth. Almost above previous reaserchers tried
to control the endogenous phenomena and reduce the error term of specific
characteristic of each countries by adding some control variables to their
models such as: total investment, government expenditure, tax revenue, trade
value, inflation, total population and human development index beacause of
that these variables are close relationship with growth of economy.

       In accordance with Barro (1990) and Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1992),
the empirical model for estimating degrees of tax revenue and government
expenditure on economic growth are expanded as seen as below:

𝑙𝑟𝑔𝑑𝑝𝑖,𝑡 = 𝛼0 + 𝛼1 𝑙𝑟𝑔𝑑𝑝𝑖,𝑡−1 + 𝛼2 𝐹𝐷𝐼𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛼3 𝐼𝑁𝐹𝐿𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛼4 𝐻𝐷𝐼𝑖,𝑡 +

where, 𝐹𝐷𝐼𝑖,𝑡 stands for foreign direct investment ratio with GDP, 𝑖𝑛𝑓𝑙𝑖,𝑡 is
inflation rate of country i (i=1,…N) at time t (t=1,…T), ℎ𝑑𝑖𝑖,𝑡 is human
development index, surveyed and measured by United Nations Development
Program (UNDP), 𝐺𝑂𝑉𝑖,𝑡 stands for governance evaluated by control of
corruption indicator or corruption perception index, 𝑃𝑈𝐵𝑖,𝑡 represents the
public finance that í measured by the ratio between total tax revenue and
general government expenditure to GDP, and 𝐺𝑂𝑉_𝑃𝑈𝐵𝑖,𝑡 denotes the
                                       77



interaction between governance and total tax revenue and general government
expenditure.

       As we may know that total tax revenue can indicate the total capability
of a system of tax collection and the general government expenditure denotes
fully effective spending of a government, therefore these are the reasons for
choosing tax revenue and government spending as public finance variables in
our model. There are little researchers evaluated the role of public finance in a
growth model. Furthermore, public finance affects production inputs and tax
revenue has influences on investment climate of countries so that we should
investigate the link between total tax revenue, general government
expenditure, and economic growth in long run .

       To achieve small bias from specification of the error term, this study
adds control variables to the above models, including foreign direct
investment rate to GDP per capita represented the investment climate,
inflation, and human development index.

3. 6 Verification of non-linear

       Nevertheless, to ensure the robustness of estimation, this study also
conducts the non-linear correlation test with the null hypothesis of that being
between the dependent variable and control variables is a non-linear
relationship.

3.7. Summary

       Three major theories, public finance, corruption, and endogenous
growth, provide an understanding of the nature of the research problems. So
that we can persuade people to believe that this study was designed using an
appropriate analytical framework, and that strong empirical models were built
to estimate the relationships among public finance, corruption, and economic
                                      78



growth in both developed and developing countries. First, an error correction
(EC) model provides evidence of the long-run relationship between public
finance and economic growth. Second, a Granger test helps confirm the
causality direction of the linkage between tax revenue and government
expenditure to enrich the “tax-spend” and “spend-tax” hypotheses. Third, a
SUR model provides evidence of the robustness of the estimation of the effect
of public finance on an economy, as well as confirms the estimation of the
direction, how corruption modifies the effect of public finance on an economy,
and confirms the role of corruption as a “greasing or salting the wheels” of an
economy. Last, adopting the SUR and SGMM models helps overcome the
endogenous phenomenon. It also indicates the influence of public finance on
economic growth and helps describe the relationship between public finance
and economic growth in more detail.

       Table 4.1 shows the large differences in income per capita between
developing and developed countries. The maximum of real GDP per capita
can be bigger than the minimum by 490 times. The largest gap between the
highest rate of tax revenue or expenditure and its lowest is 7 times. The
highest indicator of control of corruption is 2.47, while the lowest is only
-1.53. These facts suggest a reason to examine the relationships among these
variables in both developed and developing countries.

       Table 4.2 shows that public finance, corruption and economic growth
are strongly and significantly correlated, and that tax revenue and expenditure
are closely correlated with each other.

        For the less bias from spurious regression as well as co-integration test
running, this paper employs the unit root test following Harris-Tzavalis (HT)
(1999) test and Im-Pesaran-Shin (IPS) (2003) (see explanations in the point
3.4).

       Table 4.3 indicates that only “GDP per capita” variable that does not
stay. Bujang et al. (2013) support this finding, which demands identification of
co-integration linkages between non-stationary variables and others.

       Tables 4.3 and 4.4 provide evidence of stationarity for all variables;
these results indicate that there is no unit root in the error term of the panel
dataset.

4.2. Long-run relationship between public finance and economic growth

       Performing co-integration test helps this study to meet the part of first
objective and the first research question as seen as below:

       How closely does public finance correlate with the economy in the long
run?

       Table 4.5

Westerlund long-run cointegration test results

Dependent variable: lrgdp (Average AIC selected lag length: <1).

       To answer the first research question, this study chooses economic
growth to be the dependent variable. Additionally, economic growth
represents the total factors of production so it may be a dominant variable
(Garrett and Rhine, 2006) if we choose "economic growth" to be a control
variable it could provide the bias results due to its power in the growth model.
        H0: There is no long-term co-integration linkage for each pair of
        variables.

        As mentioned in chapter three: the 𝐺𝑎 and Gt test statistics to check the
null hypothesis for at least one i. These statistics start from a weighted average
of the individually estimated Ga to measure 𝑎𝑖′ s and Gt measuring their t-
                                       84



ratio's, respectively. The Pa and Pt test statistics pool information over all the
cross-sectional units to test H0: ai = 0 for all i, (i= 1,…N) and H1: : ai < 0 for
all I, (i= 1,…N). Rejection of H0 is thus substantial to validate an existence of
co-integration given the entire the panel. Table 4.5 indicated that almost 𝐺𝑎 , Gt
Pa, Pt are satisfied the requirement to reject the null hypothesis (Westerlund,
2007).

         The results of the cointegration test indicate that the link between
public finance and economic growth is co-integrated. This finding helps table
4.5 to prove the first hypothesis (1): There is a long-run correlation between
public finance and economic growth. Unlike previous studies such as Barro
(1990), who noted both the long-run and the short-run relationships between
fiscal budgets and economic growth or Bleaney, Gemmell, and Kneller (2001)
confirmed that neither taxation or expenditure fully affect economic growth in
the long run, this study confirms the persistence of link between two part of
public finance. The confirmation support the policymakers should focus on
both tax revenue and the government expenditure to handle deficit as well as
to promote their economy.

         Furthermore, continuing to verify the long-term relationship between
two components of public finance, this study found that tax revenue has the
long-run linkage with government expenditure (see table 4.6).

             Table 4.6 shows the evidence for rejection of the null hypothesis, so
       this research can confirm that there is a long-run relationship between tax
       revenue and expenditure.

4.3.   Linkage between tax revenue and government expenditure

            Since the co-integration test cannot confirm the direction of the causal
       linkage between tax revenue and government expenditure, this study conducts
       a pairwise Granger test to achieve the second research objective, as well as
       answer the second research question: Do tax revenue and government
       expenditure cause each other?

   Table 4.7 indicates that between total tax revenue and general government
expenditure exists a bi-directional and causal relationship. This result supports
the fiscal synchronization hypothesis, which was validated by previous
studies, such as Musgrave (1966), Meltzer and Richard (1981), Bohn (1991),
and Chang and Chiang (2009), who run a test with single type of taxes or
single share of the government expenditure an in a single country or in a small
group of countries only. This result also suggests that policymakers in both
developed and developing countries should focus on the important role of total
tax revenue and expenditure for larger government budgets and increasing
economic outcomes. This result also supports the second hypothesis (2): tax
revenue and government expenditure cause each other. The results support the
fiscal synchronization hypothesis, which suggests that when dealing with a
deficit, governments should make decisions relating to collecting taxes and
government spending jointly.

4.4. Results of examining role of governance in modifying effect between
public finance and economic growth

4.4.1 The role of governance in modifying effect between public finance and
economic growth in developing countries

       To fix the endogeneity phenomenon, this study applies the SUR model
to estimate the effect of governance on economic growth and the way it affects
the economy through its interaction with public finance. Nevertheless, the
SGMM estimation helps reduce the regression bias compared to a fixed effects
model (Baltagi, 2005). Roodman (2009) noted that SGMM estimation
typically includes more instruments, which may, therefore, increase the
efficiency of the regression. Additionally, to define the solution for the third
research question, this study follows Bassanini and Scarpetta, who find that
dynamic models are appropriate for large N and large T. However, dynamic
panel data always face autocorrelation problems, and thus, we employ the
                                                         87



Arellano–Bond test to identify the autocorrelation of the various error terms;
in other words, E (∆𝑈𝑖𝑡 , ∆𝑈𝑖𝑡−2 = 0) (Arellano & Bond 1991).

Table 4.8

        Before running estimation, this study tries to divide the panel data into
two groups: developed and developing countries following the classification
of countries by World Bank on July 1, 2015.

      Table 4.8 indicates that governance, tax revenue, and interaction
between them positively affect economic growth, but government expenditure
has a significantly negative effect on economic growth when it stays alone.
However, the interaction between governance and government expenditure
becomes the beneficial factor for growth. These findings support the “salting”
role of corruption in the wheels of an economy (Méon and Weill, 2010; Ugur,
2014; Dzhumashev, 2014). The result also supports D’Agostino, Dunne and
Pieroni (2016), who confirmed the direct positive effect of control of
corruption on economic growth. Furthermore, we considered the endogenous
variables in our SGMM model as “economic growth,” because the lag of this
variable can affect on itself. We then used instrumental variables of
“governance” to correct the endogeneity phenomenon (Mauro, 1995;
Acemoglue et al., 1998; Aizenman & Glick, 2006; d’Agostino et al., 2016).
Additionally, to gain the effective results from SUR model, we choose the
option “corr” to test the correlation between dependent variables in the system
regression and all the test results confirm that among dependent variables such
as “economic growth”, “tax revenue” and “government expenditure” are
correlated (see table appendix A8). Through table 4.8, this study also confirms
that foreign direct investment rate to GDP (FDI) is a beneficial factor for
growth, while the unstable situation of an economy could be harmful to
increase economic outcome.

        Unlike developing countries, the interaction between governance and
tax revenue in developed countries has negative effect on economic growth
without any significance. This finding suggests that policymakers in
developed countries should focus on fiscal policy more than anti-corruption
policy in taxation to remain their growth. The other remain variables have the
same influence with developing countries. Both table 4.8 and 4.9 presented in
this chapter prove the third hypothesis (3): Governance modifies the effects of
public finance on economic growth differently according to different group
countries. Unlike Imam and Jacobs (2007), this study verifies the role of
governance in modifying the link between public finance and economic
                                      90



growth. The findings denote the crucial role of governance in anti-corruption
as well as in promoting the economy. The good governance with the high
score of control of corruption indicator could increase the efficiency of
government expenditure and encourage their economy.

        To ensure the robustness of the model, we continue using other data,
which measures the corruption perception index (CPI) of businesses by the
Transparency International organization. The results were consistent with the
results of the control of corruption indicator from The World Bank website
(see table 4.10 and 4.11).

        We used the corruption perception index (CPI) developed by
Transparency International (TI). The maximum index is 100 and indicates that
countries, which receive the maximum index, are free of corruption. Table 4.8

and 4.9 show the consistent results of the control of corruption indicator (CCI)
compared to the corruption perception index (CPI) in tables 4.10 and 4.11.
Tables 4.10 and 4.11 provide a robustness check of the role of governance in
modifying the relationship between public finance and economic growth.

       Chapter 4 debates the long-run relationship between public finance and
economic growth. Applying ECM model we found that tax revenue and
government expenditure have a strong relationship with economic growth in
long-term in both developed and developing countries. Furthermore,
conducting Ganger test helps this research to identify the bi-directional linkage
between tax revenue and government expenditure. The finding also supports
the fiscal synchronization hypothesis, which recommends government in both
developed and developing countries for controlling deficit, they should focus
on assignment of taxes as well as on public spending.

       This chapter also discusses the relationships among governance, public
finance, and economic growth. Running a seemingly unrelated regression
(SUR) and SGMM models, this chapter confirms that governance has a
positive role in economies. The findings support the “salting of wheels”
effects of corruption in an economy. Additionally, the interaction between
governance and public finance has a diverse effect on economic growth
depending on different groups of countries and kind of part of public finance
such as tax revenue or government expenditure.

       Furthermore, the corruption perception of business data, which is
evaluated by Transparency International, was applied; this research provides
evidence of a robustness check for the SUR and SGMM models. This result
suggests that analysis of the governance effect through seemingly unrelated
regression should provide robust results.

                             CHAPTER 5:

       CONCLUSION, IMPLICATION AND LIMITATION


5.1. Conclusion

      This study applies an ECM model for panel data from 82 countries in
the 21-year period (1996–2016) to verify the co-integration linkages among
public finance and economic growth in both developed and developing
countries. Second, employing Granger pairwise causality tests confirms the
                                       94



synchronization hypothesis that a bi-directional causal relationship exists
between tax revenue and government expenditure. These findings support the
“fiscal synchronization” hypothesis. On that basis, suitable and effective fiscal
policies can be subsequently formulated to promote the healthy development
of these economies during the coming years.
       To investigate the role of governance in modifying the effects of public
finance on economic growth, this study conducts both SUR and SGMM
models for the strong balanced panel data of 38 developed and 44 developing
countries. The findings confirm that governance has both direct and indirect
positive effects on economic growth in developed and developing countries.
First, this factor is a beneficial factor for the growth of an economy. The result
suggests that government in both developed and developing countries should
try to improve their governance in anti-corruption for developing their
economies. Second, the interaction between this factor and any subcomponent
of the public finance could diversely affect the economy. For instance, in
developing countries, the interaction between governance and government
expenditure supports the government spending effectively. This finding
confirms that government in developing countries should spend more time to
concern the anti-corruption policy with fiscal policy to increase their capacity
of collecting taxes and using tax revenue for promoting their economies. On
the other hand, in developed countries, the interaction between governance
and tax revenue does not support the government in collecting taxes so the
government in these countries should focus their anti-corruption separately in
choosing fiscal policy.

       Verifying robustness of control of corruption indicator (CCI) using the
corruption perception index (CPI) that is measured by Transparency
International organization, this research confirms that anti-corruption always
plays an important role in increasing the economy in both developed and
developing countries. Additionally, to grow their economies, the governance
                                       95



in anti-corruption in developing countries has the more power than in
developed ones.

       These findings suggest that policymakers in both developed countries
should pay more attention to increase the effectiveness of public finance
system and the tools for anti-corruption separately. In contrast, the government
in developing countries should focus on the interaction between the control of
corruption and public finance jointly to collect more taxes as well as to spend
on public goods more effectively. The research results also support the
literature of quality governance to prove the important role of the government
in anti-corruption in the worldwide.

5.2. Suggestion to policy makers
       Through the first research finding, this study suggests that
policymakers should focus on publishing policies related to tax revenue as
well as to government spending due to their persistence effects on economic
activities in a long-term relationship. Furthermore, dealing with the deficit, the
government in both developed and developing countries should pay more
attention to collecting taxes and reduce spending public expenditure
simultaneously due to evidence of that research results support fiscal
synchronization hypothesis.

       Second, the confirmation of the “salting” wheels of corruption in both
developed and developing economies recommends that the government in the
worldwide should focus on increasing the system of anti-corruption for raising
their economies. Furthermore, the interaction between governance and public
finance has a positive effect on the economy in developing countries
supporting that to create more budgets for promoting their economy as well as
spend tax revenue more effectively, the developing government should think
about the appropriate tools to set up the strong combat in corruption.

5.3. Research limitation and future research

       Owing to limitations in collecting data, this thesis may provide non-
strong evidence of the long-run linkages between public finance and economic
growth. A second limitation is that this study does not investigate the
influences of interaction between governance and public finance on economic
growth with the cluster of a smaller group of countries. This cluster could help
the developing government such as Vietnam or other South Earth Asian
countries to handle deficit as well as to grow their economies. Future research
should try to bridge this gap.
       Furthermore, the compliance of tax burden could be a major issue in
collecting tax revenue; therefore, we may explore its influences in future
research to explain how the compliance of tax burden affects tax revenue for
increasing the economy.

Results of variance inflation factor test (VIF4)

      Acording to Weisberg (2005), p. 216 we learn that using “collinear
predictors can lead to unacceptably variable estimated coefficients compared
to problems with no collinearity”. In a mean function:
      𝐸 (𝑌|𝑋1 = 𝑥1 , 𝑋2 = 𝑥2 ) = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝑥1 + 𝛽2 𝑥2 ,
      suppose r1,2 is the sample correlation between 𝑥1 and 𝑥2 , and define the:
       𝑆𝑋𝑖 𝑋𝑗 = ∑(𝑥𝑖𝑗 − 𝑥̅𝑗 )2 to be the sum of square for the jth term in the
mean function. For j=1,2 we so that:
                                                𝜎2       1
                                  𝑉𝑎𝑟(𝛽̂

                       ̂1 and 𝛽
      The variances of 𝛽      ̂2 are minimized if 𝑟1,2
                                                   2               2
                                                       = 0, while 𝑟1,2 is near 1,
                                                      2
these variances are greatly inflated, for example if 𝑟1,2 = 0.95, the variance
̂1 𝑖𝑠 20 times as large as if 𝑟1,2

    VIF is variance inflation factor, which was developed by Marquardt ( 1970)
                                          19



Assuming that Xj’s could have been sampled to make 𝑅𝑗2 = 0, while keeping SXiXj
constant, the VIF represents the increase in variance due to correlation between the
predictors and hence, collinearity. In case of that 𝑅𝑗2 = (0.95)2 VIF should be 1/(1-
0.952) = 10.256. A rule of thumb is that if VIF(𝛽̂
                                                 𝑗 ) >10 then multicollinearity is
high.

Mean VIF                                    8.57
Except CCI, CPI and TAXgdp that have VIF >10, other remain variances are
smaller than 10, hence we can confirm that among economic growth, tax
revenue and control of corruption exist the close correlation.
