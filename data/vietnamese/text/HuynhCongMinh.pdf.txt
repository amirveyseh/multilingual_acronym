1.1 Research context and gaps

1.1.1 Practical background

   For recent decades, shadow economy, investment from abroad, institutional quality
and income inequality have attracted a great deal of attention in development
economics because all of them relate to economic growth. Both of foreign direct
investment (FDI) and institutional quality (IQ) are considered important determinants
of economic growth and development (Borensztein, Gregorio, & Lee, 1998; Nair-
Reichert & Weinhold, 2001; Rodrik, Subramanian, & Trebbi, 2004; Acemoglu,
                                                     2




Johnson, & Robinson, 2005; Hansen & Rand, 2006; Varsakelis, 2006; and Kandil,
2009). While the official economy is closely related to the shadow economy (Schneider
& Bajada, 2003; Vo & Pham, 2014). Moreover, economic growth is associated with
income inequality (Kuznets, 1955; Barro, 2000). Especially, these variables and their
relationships become worth studying in the context of Asia for its rising thorny
features, such as high flow of FDI but low institutional quality, large shadow economy
and rising income inequality.

    First, global foreign direct investment has significantly grown since the 1970s,
reached $1.76 trillion in 2015, fell 13% in 2016 ($1.52 trillion) and recovered in 2017;
especially, developing Asia is now the largest recipient and accounts for almost one-
third of total FDI inflows (UNCTAD, 2017). It is seen as the result of Asian countries
in effort to attract FDI for economic development by adopting an open door policy,
governance changes & institutional innovation (Haggard, 2004; Lee, 2002). However,
the positive impact of FDI on economic growth depends on the institutional quality in
the host countries (Brahim & Rachdi, 2014; Jude & Levieuge, 2017). It is also Asia‘s
specific concern, especially when there are many countries might be stuck in middle
income trap in the region and deficient institutional quality is one of the main causes
(Dollar, 2015). Figure 1.1 describes the institutional quality by 5 components
(including Voice and Accountability, Political Stability and Absence of Violence,
Government Effectiveness, Regulatory Quality, and Rule of Law) in 19 Asian
countries1 on average from 2002-2015. The scale of measurement ranks from -2.5
(lowest quality) to 2.5 (highest quality). In general, the institutional quality in Asian
countries is low. The improvement has been seen but it is a slow progress. FDI has
flowed into Asian countries in great amounts, but institutional quality is still

problematic in the region. Whether institutional quality really helps attracting FDI and
FDI in its turn helps improving institutional quality. Does this bidirectional relationship
exist in Asian countries?

   Second, the shadow economy problematizes policy-makers in Asia, because the
size of the shadow economies in Asian countries has grown considerably since 1989,
suggesting that national accounts data is on average significantly underestimated as
national accounts are not supposed to capture shadow economies (Bajada and
Schneider, 2005). The estimated average size of shadow economy in Asian countries
over 1999 to 2015 is 30.94 % of official gross domestic products (GDP), and this
period experiences an increase of 10.24% in the shadow economy size (Medina &
Schneider, 2018). The lowest and the highest sizes are 29.04% and 33.41% in 2006 and
2009 respectively. The size of shadow economy in Asian countries is empirically
                                                                   4




    attributed to the money demand, tax burden, private consumption, interest rate and
    Gross National Income (GNI) per capita (Bajada & Schneider, 2005; Vo et al., 2015).
    The presence of shadow economy distorts the allocation of resources, alters income
    distribution and reduces governments‘ tax revenue (Alm & Embaye, 2013). If we
    ignore this sector, it is biased to evaluate the consequences of various economic
    policies. Thus, it is imperative to comprehensively understand about the shadow
    economy in Asia in relation with other variables such as FDI and institutional quality.
    Whether FDI is a channel to improve institutional quality and the improvement in
    institutional quality helps reduce shadow economy when institutional quality is a driver
    of shadow economy? The figure 1.2 shows the shadow economy and FDI in Asian
    countries on average from 1999-2015.

   Third, recent rapid economic growth in Asia has reduced poverty but widened
income gap in many countries. To Zhuang, Kanbur, and Maligalig (2014), the Asia-
wide Gini index rose at an annual rate of 1.4% from 0.39 in the mid-1990s to 0.46 in
the late 2000s; 14 of 37 Asian economies now have a Gini coefficient of 0.40 or
greater, widely considered the threshold for ―high inequality‖. However, the
comparison between the two periods of mid-1990s and around-2012 shows that the
average Gini index for 19 developing Asian countries decreases by 5.22%. This
improvement in income inequality mostly came from Central Asian countries such as
Kyrgyz Republic, Kazakhstan, and Maldives. Gini indexes were also seen falling in
Cambodia, Thailand, Nepal, Malaysia and Mongolia. On the contrary, China,
Indonesia and India - covering 82% of the population in the region- experienced a
rapid rising income inequality with their increases in Gini indexes by 18.8%, 14.9%
and 14.1% respectively. The income inequality was also found rising in Sri Lanka,
Laos, Pakistan, Vietnam and Tajikistan. The figure 1.3 provides the recent trends of
income inequality in 19 Asian developing countries.

Figure 1.3. Recent trends of income inequality in Asian developing countries

       (Source: World Bank, 2017a)

       The rising inequality matters for many reasons. First, highly unequal societies
with the concentration of wealth on the rich are less likely to consolidate democracy,
and may end up with social unrest or even coups (Acemoglu & Robinson, 2001).
Second, it hampers the pace at which growth enables poverty reduction (Ravallion,
2004). Third, the inequality undermines the growth process through many channels of
economic, social, and political mechanisms; it negatively affects growth and its
sustainability (Ostry, Berg, & Tsangarides, 2014). Fourth, income inequality causes
low quality of institutions- one of key factors for development (Chong & Gradstein,
2007b; and Zhuang et al., 2010); and excessively high levels of inequality erode
institutional quality even in democracies (Kotschy & Sunde, 2016).

       From the practical background above, there is a need to study the relationships
amongst these variables so that policy makers can be provided with empirical studies
for their decision-making in dealing with these aggregate variables simultaneously.
However, the motivation for carrying out this study is arisen not only from the practical
background but also from the theoretical background.

1.1.2 Theoretical background

   FDI, institutional quality and shadow economy

   The failure in explaining economic phenomenon by one theory has led to the
tendency of using an integrative approach to bring insights in recent decades (Torgler
& Schneider, 2009). In fact, FDI is long documented as the main driver of host
countries‘ economic growth (Borensztein et al., 1998; Nair-Reichert & Weinhold,
2001; and Hansen       & Rand, 2006), while the emerge of the new institutional
economics in recent decades gets a great deal of attention from economists (Kotschy &
                                            7




Sunde, 2016; Neyapti & Arasil, 2016). On the other hand, a vast literature has
attempted to study the shadow economy, especially from the transformation of the
socialist economies such as China, Russia, and Vietnam in 1990s where institutional
weaknesses and corruption are major obstacles to their market reforms (Gupta & Abed,
2002; Torgler & Schneider, 2009). Knowing the unknown and estimating the shadow
economy are still a difficult task that has posed notable challenges in statistical studies
in the past decades (Torgler & Schneider, 2009). Fortunately, the availability of
shadow economy‘s dataset re-highlighted the interests of economists into the
relationships between shadow economy and other factors from both sides of economics
and institutions (Gupta & Abed, 2002).

       The nexuses between FDI, institutional quality and shadow economy can be
divided into three strands with ambiguous relationships. In the first strand, the
relationships between FDI and institutional quality are concentrated, following
theories of international trade and institutions. In particular, Dunning (1980) uses the
eclectic paradigm, also known as the OLI-Model or OLI-Framework, to explain the
various reasons why a multinational corporation (MNC) enters into a host country. To
him, an MNC decides to invest in the host country when advantages of OLI
(Ownership, Location, and Internalization) are met. In this context, governance and
institutions can be seen as a location factor that may encourage or deter the investment
inflows. Similarly, North (1990) with the institutionalization theory shows that
institutions set ―the rule of the games‖ which organizations and MNCs must follow in
pursuit of their own learning and goals for resource allocation. To him, institutions
affect uncertainty level and allow individuals and firms interact effectively. To attract
investments, governments improve their governance to lower transaction costs in
which investors might get higher profitability. In addition, Westney (1993), by using a
framework of MNCs theory, explores the potential significant role of MNCs in
                                            8




improving the organizational patterns in host countries through subsidiaries. Thus, to
the above theories, institutional quality is a key determinant of FDI and FDI in its turn
helps improve institutional quality in the host country. However, He (2006) with the
Pollution Haven Hypothesis suggests that the motives of some FDI firms are to find a
place to hide pollution, and developing countries with lax environmental regulations is
the destination for these businesses. By this view, low institutional quality will attract
polluting FDI firms.

   Most of studies argued the role of institutional quality in determining FDI inflows
with three categories: i) FDI is positively affected by institutional quality represented
by single indicators such as transparency (Zhao et al, 2003), democratic accountability
(Busse & Hefeker, 2007), intellectual property rights and contract enforcement (Du et
al, 2008), political rights and civil liberties (Tintin, 2013); ii) There is no impact of
institutional quality on attracting FDI (Kandil, 2009; Bellos & Subasat, 2011; Farla et
al., 2014; and Iloie, 2015); and iii) the new argument, especially in the case of China‘s
outward FDI, is found that the low institutional quality attracts higher FDI inflow (Fan,
Morck, Xu, & Yeung, 2009). Meanwhile, the feedback effect of FDI on institutional
quality of host countries has received less attention from researchers. Larrain &
Tavares (2004) find that FDI significantly reduces corruption levels. Long, Yang, &
Zhang (2015) find the same results on the effects of FDI inflows on institutional
quality. However, the bidirectional relationship between FDI and institutional quality is
largely ignored except by a few including Fukumi & Nishijima (2010) for Latin
America & the Caribbean, and Shah et al. (2015) for Pakistan. Then what is the
bidirectional relationship between FDI and institutional quality in Asian countries and
is it illustrated by the Eclectic paradigm (Dunning, 1980), the Institutionalization
theory (North, 1990), the MNCs theory (Westney, 1993), or He (2006) with the
Pollution haven hypothesis? It is an empirical gap needed to fill, giving policy-makers
                                            9




with evidences to consolidate their decision on FDI attraction and institutional
innovation.

   The second strand focuses on institutional quality as a driver of shadow economy,
basing on Legalism school of thought on the informal economy. Following this view,
better institutional quality reduces the shadow economy because of two reasons: i)
better institutional quality lessens the burden of regulations and procedures - the main
cause that explain why people participate in informal activities - and thus lowers
shadow economy (Demsetz, 1974; ii) better institutional quality reveals informal
transactions which consequently turn official and hence reduces shadow economy (De
Soto, 1989, 2000). The negative impact of institutional quality on shadow economy is
empirically confirmed by Johnson et al. (1998); Friedman et al. (2000); Fugazza &
Jacques (2003), Torgler & Schneider (2009), Dreher et al. (2009), Dreher & Schneider
(2010), Singh et al. (2012), Razmi et al. (2013), and Hassan & Schneider (2016). There
is no study on the feedback effect of shadow economy on institutional quality.
However, this theoretical and empirical gap needs to be filled for 2 reasons: i) if the
feedback effect of shadow economy on institutional quality is found, Legalism theory
may be modified in the view that institutional quality is not only the cause but also the
consequence of shadow economy; and ii) studies on this relationship should take the
endogeneity problems into consideration. To fill this gap, I argue that shadow economy
reduces the tax revenue and falling tax revenue diminishes government income which
leads to less capacity to provide public goods with high quality.

   The third strand examines the linkage of FDI and shadow economy. To the best of
my review, this strand is represented by three studies by Nikopour et al. (2009),
Davidescu & Strat (2015) and Ali & Bohara (2017). The result from Nikopour et al
(2009) indicates that higher FDI reduces shadow economy. However, Nikopour et al.
(2009) do not explain through which channels that FDI can negatively affect shadow
                                           10




economy. Similarly, Davidescu & Strat (2015) find a negative unidirectional short-run
causality that runs only from FDI to the shadow economy in the case of Romania.
Meanwhile, Ali & Bohara (2017) confirm that higher shadow economy increases FDI
inflows since MNCs take advantages of tax evasion in host countries with higher size
of shadow economy. However, this bidirectional nexus needs to be further re-examined
for both theoretical and empirical aspects for 2 reasons. First, it is imperative to
research through which channels that FDI can affect shadow economy as well as
shadow economy can affect FDI. Second, policy makers in Asia will be provided by
empirical results to deal with FDI and shadow economy simultaneously whereas FDI
inflows contribute to economic growth (Borensztein et al., 1998; Nair-Reichert &
Weinhold, 2001; and Hansen & Rand, 2006), but shadow economy is regarded as one
of the major threats of development (Friedman et al., 2000; Ihrig & Moe, 2004; Alm &
Embaye, 2013; and Porta & Shleifer, 2014). Taking institutional quality into the
bidirectional relationship between FDI and shadow economy is the contribution to the
third strand by combining the three theories including international trade,
institutionalization and Legalism. It is argued that FDI can reduce shadow economy
through the channel of institutional quality improvements resulted from FDI inflows;
and higher shadow associated with lower institutional quality which may discourage
FDI inflows. Besides, FDI inflows may have potential impacts on shadow economy by
other channels such as creating jobs and increasing the official economic growth.

   As argued above, though FDI, institutional quality and shadow economy are inter-
correlated and even inter-dependently, their mutual relationships remain the gap in the
literature. This gap is imperative to be filled in because of two reasons. First, studying
on this mutual relationship formulates the mechanism in which these variables interact
to foster economic growth, by using an integrative approach of combining three
relevant theories. Second, FDI, institutional quality and shadow economy attract great
                                           11




attention from policies makers because all of them are closely associated with
economic growth and development. The demonstrated results of their mutual
relationships indicate that policies to tackle any one of them can affect the other two at
the same time, and governments need empirical evidences to consolidate their policy-
making on dealing with these aggregate variables simultaneously.

   Shadow economy and income inequality

   The shadow economy attracts researchers on studying not only its causes but also
its effects. The shadow economy has an impact on many variables such as the labour
market (Voinea and Liviu-Albu, 2011; Castells & Portes, 1989; Portes & Benton,
1984); the productivity (Friedman et al., 2000; Ihrig & Moe, 2004; La Porta & Shleifer,
2014); economic growth (De Soto, 1989; Johnson et al., 1997; and Loayza, 1997); and
poverty (Kim, 2005; Nikopour & Habibullah, 2010; and De Martiis, 2014). However,
attempts to investigate the impact of shadow economy on income inequality are still
scarce. Rosser et al. (2000, 2003), by macroeconomic approach of using empirical data
for 16 transition economies between 1987 to 1989 and 1993 to 1994, conclude with
caution that there is a positive relationship between the degree of income inequality
and the size of the informal economy. An increase in inequality causes more informal
activities due to the decline in social solidarity and trust, and expanding informal
activities lead to more inequality because of falling tax revenues and weakened
redistributive policies.

   However, I propose new arguments in this thesis that shadow economy has a
negative impact on income inequality by combining three schools of thought on
shadow economy, including Dualism, Legalism and Voluntarism, with two theoretical
points as follows. First, Dualists with the residue theory depict the shadow economy as
a set of survival activities performed in a marginal society, generating income for the
poor (Hart, 1973; Sethuraman, 1976; and Tokman, 1978). Although the classical theory
                                           12




of distribution concludes that income inequality increases in the process of economic
growth because the expanding industrial sector absorbs the labor force surplus from the
agriculture without increasing wages; classical economists did not forecast that
marginal people who cannot be absorbed in the industrial sector may work
underground, and increase their income by this way. Thus by taking point into account,
the shadow economy is expected to increase the income share of the poor. Second,
Legalists and Voluntarists with the alternative theory of shadow economy contend that
the rising shadow economy creates unfair competition for businesses and employees
between the formal and informal sectors (Chen, 2012). Nevertheless, this unfair
competition between the two sectors eventually turns out to be a channel to help reduce
income inequality because to dual approach, shadow economy attracts most of the poor
and small businesses, but not the rich and big businesses. Therefore, the unfair
competition from shadow economy may reduce the income share of the rich as the
poor get more benefit from working underground. As a result, the shadow economy
may lessen the income inequality. This new argument needs to be empirically
confirmed in the context of Asia for two reasons. First, if this negative affect is
demonstrated, the research will extend theories in the context of Asian developing
countries on the positive effects of shadow economy in the literature. Second, the result
may provide policy-makers with empirical evidences that policies to deal with the
shadow economy should take the poor into close consideration with other simultaneous
solutions for poverty eradication and income inequality reduction.

       In summary, for the above practical background, theoretical background and
research gaps, the thesis is carried out to examine the inter-relationship among FDI,
institutional quality and shadow economy, as well as to investigate the impact of
shadow economy on income inequality in Asian countries. The research objectives will
be presented in details as below.
                                           13




1.2 Research objectives

       The thesis has two main objectives: (1) to examine the causal relationship
among FDI, institutional quality and shadow economy in Asian countries; (2) to
investigate the impact of shadow economy on income inequality and the channel of the
impact in Asia.

1.3 Research questions

   To solve the two main objectives as mentioned above, the thesis aims at answering
5 questions as below.

        First, what is the bidirectional nexus between FDI inflows and institutional
          quality?
        Second, what is the bidirectional linkage between institutional quality and
          shadow economy?
        Third, what is the bidirectional relationship between shadow economy and
          FDI?
        Fourth, how does the interaction of institutional quality and FDI affect
          shadow economy?
        Fifth, how does shadow economy affect income inequality and what are the
          channels of the effect?

       The above first four questions are designed to solve the first research objective.
The last question is to deal with the second research objective.

1.4 Research subjects and scope

       The above research questions will be answered correctly and specifically when
the subject and scope of the study are limited in a specific way. In the thesis, research
subjects are: the bidirectional relationships among FDI, institutional quality, and the
                                           14




shadow economy; and the impact of shadow economy on income inequality in Asia.
These concepts are legibly defined in the chapter 2 (section 2.1.1, 2.2.1, 2.3.1). The
research scope is limited in 19 Asian countries, including China, Mongolia, India,
Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Indonesia,
Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Kazakhstan, and
Kyrgyzstan. Data for variables in the thesis are annually collected in the period 1999-
2015.

1.5 Research methodology and data

        The quantitative methodology is employed to deal with both research objectives.
To examine the relationship among FDI, institutional quality and shadow economy in
Asian countries, the author uses the simultaneous equation panel data model (SEM)
including three equations for three independent variables: FDI, institutional quality and
shadow economy. The SEM model is estimated by both econometric methods: The
Three-stage Least Squares (3SLS) and the Two-step System Generalized Method of
Moments (System GMM). 3SLS is as an appropriate estimation method for the SEM
model when Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimator for SEM will be biased,
inconsistent, and inappropriate (Zellner and Theil, 1962). The Two-step System GMM
can perform with linear dynamic panel-data estimation to solve the problems of
endogeneity, heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation (Blundell and Bond, 1998).
Meanwhile, the linear equation model is applied for studying the impact of show
economy on income inequality, using two ways of estimations: Fixed Effects (FE) and
Random Effects (RE), which can remove the effects of country unobserved
characteristics. The Two-step System GMM is also employed to check the robustness
of the estimation and to control endogeneity caused by the feedback effect of income
inequality on shadow economy.
                                           15




       Data for all variables in the models are collected from: Medina & Schneider
(2018); World Development Indicators (WDI) from World Bank (WB), Worldwide
Governance Indicators (WGIs) from WB; The International Country Risk Guide
(ICRG) provided by the Political Risk Services (PRS) Group; UNESCO Institute for
Statistics; Global Wage Report 2017 provided by International Labor Organization
(ILO); Freedom in the World, Freedom House; Index of Economic Freedom, The
Heritage Foundation; Economic Freedom Report 2016, the Fraser Institute; Global
Competitiveness Index (GCI), World Economic Forum; KOF Globalization Index,

(UNCTAD).

1.6 Contribution

   The research will be expected to have certain significance for both academic and
practical contributions.

   First, the research combines the three theories of international trade, institutions
and shadow economy with an integrative approach to investigate the three-way
linkages between FDI, institutional quality and shadow economy in the context of
Asian countries, formulating the mechanism these variables interact to foster economic
growth. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first study that explores the three-way
linkages amongst these variables. In particular, the thesis fills the empirical gap of the
positive bidirectional relationship between FDI inflows and institutional quality in the
context of Asian countries by combining the Eclectic Paradigm (Dunning, 1980) and
the Institutionalization Theory (North, 1990), opposing the Pollution Haven Hypothesis
(He, 2006) on aggregate level. In addition, the negative bidirectional nexus between
institutional quality and shadow economy found from the thesis modifies the Legalism
theory of shadow economy: institutional quality is not only the cause (main arguments
                                            16




of Legalists) but also the consequence of shadow economy (findings from the thesis);
and therefore studies on this relationship should take the endogeneity problems into
consideration. Furthermore, the negative bidirectional relationship between FDI and
shadow economy fills the theoretical and empirical gaps in Asia by taking institutional
quality into account: FDI inflows reduce shadow economy through the channel of
institutional quality improvements resulted from FDI inflows; higher shadow is
associated with lower institutional quality which discourages FDI inflows; and the
interaction of FDI and institutional quality also has a negative impact on shadow
economy, indicating that FDI inflows negatively affect the shadow economy and
institutional quality improvements intensify this effect.

   Second, a simultaneous-equation modelling approach of both non-dynamic and
dynamic functions is employed to examine the three-way relationships between FDI,
institutional quality and shadow economy for the first time. In specific, the Three-stage
Least Squares (3SLS) and the Two Steps System Generalized Method of Moments
(SGMM) are applied to estimate the three-way causality effects: i) institutional quality
and shadow economy on FDI; ii) FDI and shadow economy on institutional quality;
and iii) FDI and institutional quality on shadow economy. Especially, with the dynamic
simultaneous-equation model, taking the impacts of the past values of three
independent variables into account, the author estimates the short-run elasticities,
instead of long-run elasticities in which panel cointegration and panel unit root
approach were used in the literature for some of the above separate linkages such as
FDI – institutional quality nexus or the impact of institutional quality on shadow
economy.

   Third, the research examines the negative impact of shadow economy on income
inequality by increasing the income share held by lowest quintile and decreasing the
income share held by highest quintile. This result is opposite to previous studies
                                           17




(Rosser et al., 2000, 2003), adding more arguments to the literature which supports the
view on advantages of shadow economy especially to the poor. The findings can be
explained by combining the three schools of thought on shadow economy: Dualism,
Legalism and Volutarism with two theoretical points: First, Dualists with the residue
theory depict the shadow economy as a set of survival activities performed in a
marginal society, generating income for the poor (Hart, 1973; Sethuraman, 1976; and
Tokman, 1978). Thus the shadow economy is expected to increase the income share of
the poor. Second, Legalists and Voluntarists with the alternative theory of shadow
economy contend that the rising shadow economy creates unfair competition for
businesses and employees between the formal and informal sectors (Chen, 2012).
Nevertheless, this unfair competition between the two sectors eventually turns out to be
a channel to help reduce income inequality because to dual approach, shadow economy
attracts most of the poor and small businesses, but not the rich and big businesses.
Therefore, the unfair competition from shadow economy may reduce the income share
of the rich as the poor get more benefit from working underground. As a result, the
shadow economy may lessen the income inequality.

   Fourth, research results are expected to provide policy-makers with empirical
evidence for their social-economic decision-making in the region by two aspects: i)
policies to simultaneously promote FDI and institutional quality are solutions for
reducing the size of shadow economy and vice versa; ii) policies to deal with the
shadow economy should take the poor into close consideration with other simultaneous
solutions for poverty eradication and inequality reduction.

1.7 Limitations

       The measurement of shadow economy seems to be sensitive to the estimation
method. Although the data set from Medina & Schneider (2018), released by IMF in
which the most popular MIMIC approach is used for shadow economy estimation, is
                                            18




the newest one that I use in this thesis, it is more robust if various scenarios of how the
shadow economy estimated should be considered. Besides, the unavailability of data is
also the weakness of the thesis when all Asian countries cannot be investigated.

1.8 Thesis outline

   The thesis is organized into six chapters. Following the introduction in chapter one,
the remainder of the thesis is structured as follows. Chapter two depicts the review of
theoretical and empirical literature. Chapter three justifies the methodologies, model
specifications, data and samples. In chapter four, the empirical results for the first
research objective are discussed. Chapter five shows the empirical results and
discussion for the second research objective. Finally, chapter six provides conclusions
and policy implications.

2.1. Shadow economy

2.1.1. Theories on shadow economy

2.1.1.1. Definition

    The ―shadow economy‖ labeled by Frey, Weck, & Pommerehne (1982) and
Schneider & Dominik (2000) is an associated part of the official economy. It is also
known as the irregular economy (Ferman, 1973; Feige, 1979), the parallel economy
(Contini, 1981), the black economy (Dilnot & Morris, 1981), the underground
economy (Simon & Witte, 1982; Feige, 1989), the informal economy (Smith, 1985),
and the unofficial economy (Johnson, Kaufmann, & Zoido-Lobaton, 1998). There is
not an adequate and coherent definition on the shadow economy in the literature. Smith
(1985) defines the shadow economy as ―market based production of goods and
services, whether legal or illegal, that escapes detection in the official estimates of
gross domestic products (GDP)‖. In other words, the shadow economy includes those
economic activities and incomes derived from them to avoid government regulations,
taxation or observation (Feige, 1989; Dell‘Anno & Schneider, 2003). Dell'Anno (2007)
regards the shadow economy as ―non-observed economy‖ (NOE) which comprises all
product activities that can be categorized into three areas: Underground production,
                                           21




informal production and illegal production. Based on a taxonomy of underground
economic activities, a broad definition of the shadow economy includes unreported
income from all market-based production of goods and services, either under monetary
or barter transactions that would generally be taxable if they were reported to the tax
authorities (Mirus and Smith, 1997). To Alm & Embaye (2013), the shadow economy
consists of ―all market-based goods and services that escape inclusion in official
accounts‖.

    In spite of adopting inconsistent definitions of shadow economy, researchers have
generally concurred on a typical aspect of the shadow economy: the sector covering
economic activities that are not recorded in the national accounts. However, this typical
aspect of the shadow economy does not specify on the incentive goals of hidden
economic activities. Schneider (2007, 2010, 2016) in a narrower way, defines the
shadow economy includes all production activities of goods and services based on
market but they are deliberately hidden from public authorities for avoiding of income
payment, tax payment, payment for social security contributions; for avoiding of
"having to meet legal labor market standards", such as maximum working hours,
minimum wages, safety standards...; for avoiding of "complying with certain
administrative procedures" such as completing administrative forms or statistical
questionnaires. Medina and Schneider (2018) estimate the size of shadow economy of
158 countries all over the world by using this definition. This definition of the shadow
economy will be also used in this research due to its comprehensive and specific
meaning.

2.1.1.2. Schools of thought

       The theories on shadow economy can be viewed from different approaches such
as dual economy sectors, labor market sectors, by-product theory, alternative theory,
                                           22




complementary theory, the context of working, and individuals‘ rational choice under
uncertainty, being categorized into five dominant schools of thought.

2.1.1.2.1. The Dualist school with the residue theory (Dual-sector model, Harris-
Todaro model, and Dual labor market theory)

       The appearance of shadow economy is initially described by Boeke (1953),
Lewis (1954) and Harris and Todaro (1970) in their models by the concepts of a dual
economy and social marginality.

       Boeke (1953) and Lewis (1954), in their Dual-sector model that gives the
grounded base for shadow theories, divide the economy into two sectors: the capitalist
and the subsistence. The capitalist sector includes those who use capital and labor,
standing for industrial (modern, urban) sector with high productivity. The subsistence
sector stands for labor supply from the agricultural (traditional, rural) sector with low
productivity. The expansion of capitalist sector draws labor from the subsistence
sector, but this rural-urban migration does not affect the output of agricultural sector
since marginal product of labor is assumed to be zero with fixed land and unlimited
labor supply. Therefore, the transfer of labor from the agricultural sector to industrial
sector continues until the industrial marginal product of labor equalizes the agricultural
marginal product of labor in equilibrium. Harris and Todaro (1970) in their named
model argue that in this equilibrium there will be positive unemployment in the urban
sector because the rural-urban transition is greater than the capacity of urban sector
which may invest in capital-intensive production methods rather than labor-intensive
ones. As a result, those people who are not absorbed in formal sector will participate in
the informal economy. The informal economy is ―just as a residue‖ (Williams, 2008).

       Similarly, the Dual labor market theory proposed by Doeringer and Piore
(1971) gives initial background implications for the presence of shadow economy. To
                                           23




this theory, the labor market can be classified into primary and secondary sectors. The
primary sector includes the privileged jobs with high salaries, status, responsibilities,
good working conditions and job security. On the other hand, the secondary sector
comprises jobs characterized by negative quality like lower wages, poor working
conditions, lacking of respect and job security, and less promotion prospects. Cross &
Johnson (2000) expand the Dual labor market theory by splitting labor market into
more other 2 sectors: informal and illegal. The informal sector includes people who are
unable to access the primary and secondary sectors. Jobs in the informal markets are
those of self-employment, unregulated arrangement and off-the-book working.
Meanwhile, all criminal activities are grouped in the illegal sector. The primary and
secondary sectors follow labor regulations and tax duties but the informal and illegal
sectors do not. The labor market categories are displayed in the table 2.1.

                        Table 2.1. Labor market classification

Primary Sector        Secondary Sector       Informal Sector         Illegal Sector
•High wage            •Low wage              •Self-employment        •Criminal
•High security        •Low security          •Casual labor           •Unregulated
•Well regulated       •Poorly regulated      •Unregulated

(Source: Cross & Johnson, 2000: 102)

       Followers for this doctrine with Dual-sector model, Harris-Todaro model, and
Dual labor market theory are called dualists who view the shadow economy as
encompassed by autonomous activities that have few linkages with the formal sector
and generate income for the poor (ILO, 1972; Hart, 1973; Sethuraman, 1976; and
Tokman, 1978). To this school of thought, two reasons for rising shadow economy are
the imbalanced rates between population growth and industrial employment, and the
mismatch between people‘s skills and industrial requirements. By this view, the
shadow economy is distinguished by some characteristics such as ease of entry, family
enterprises, small-scale of operations, unregulated and competitive markets… Dualists
                                          24




view shadow economy as a marginal society in underdevelopment and it will disappear
as a result of development advancement. Although paying less attention to the relation
between informal enterprises and government regulations as well as formal sector,
scholars suggest that governments should create more formal jobs and provide
financial and business development services to informal firms.

       However, the residue theory (dualistic approach) is criticized by three reasons.
First, the concept of a dual economy is later criticized for its descriptive rather than
explanatory feature (Harding and Jenkins, 1989). Second, the informal sector does not
disappear as expected in advanced economy (Willman-Navarro, 2008). The shadow
economy still expands with modern and industrial growth at present. Third, it is
impossible for a ―disconnection‖ between the two sectors (Potts, 2008). Other schools
of thought find that the shadow economy is linked to the formal economy through
production, trading, and distribution (Chen, Vanek & Carr, 2004).

       Chen, Vanek & Carr (2004) debated that the residue theory should be rethought.
Out of the above criticism on the residue theory, they summarize the discrepancies
between the new and old concepts of informal economy. First, the shadow economy is
not only a social marginality, but also an important provider of jobs, goods and
services for lower-income groups. Second, the shadow economy includes not only
street traders and very small-scale producers, but also a wide range of informal jobs—
both ‗old forms‘ such as casual day labor in agriculture and construction, as well as
‗new forms‘ such as temporary and part-time jobs plus homework for high tech
industries. Third, underground employment includes not only self-employment but also
salary employment, and informal firms include not only survival activities but also
stable businesses and dynamic growing enterprises. Finally, instead of not being the
subject for economic policies, informal activities are virtually affected by economic
policies.
                                            25




2.1.1.2.2. The Structuralist school with By-product theory

       Similar to Dualists, Structuralists with by-product theory view the informal
economy as a marginal sector, but in contrast to the former, describe the informal
sector as an integral part of the formal sector – a necessary by-product of the formal
economy. The shadow economy composes of subordinated economic units and
workers to reduce costs of input and labor of large capitalist companies, and thereby
increase their competitiveness (Castells and Portes, 1989; Moser 1978). The presence
of shadow economy by this thought is due to the structural nature of capitalism, the
process of industrialization and globalization (sub-contracting chains, off-shore
industries, flexible specialization). The marginalized population accepts the
exploitative work for a part of their ―survival strategy‖.

       Another reason that structuralists explain for the appearance of shadow
economy is formal labour market imperfections such as minimum wage laws or
collective bargaining agreements. These regulatory distortions keep labor costs high
and structural unemployment happens as a result. Those who cannot find formal jobs
will work in the shadow economy (Fields, 1975). However, Stiglitz (1974) and
Mazumdar (1976) argue that the labour turnover and efficiency wages can lead to a
similar formal/informal dualism. Structuralists admit the intrinsic link between the
shadow and official economies and therefore recommend that governments should
regulate both commerce and employment relationships to reduce inequality between
―big businesses‖ and subordinated producers and workers.

       Both of dualists and structuralists have a feature in common for depicting the
shadow economy: the engagement in the shadow economy is a necessity rather than a
choice. However, the concept of a dual economy (dualists) and social marginality
                                           26




(structruralists) are opposed by legalists and voluntarists who approach the shadow
economy under the alternative theory and the theory of individuals‘ rational choice.
They do not view the informal economy as a set of survival activities performed in a
marginal society. They find a dependency of unofficial economy on official one
although it can be either alternative or complementary.

2.1.1.2.3. The Legalist school with alternative theory

       The Legalist school sees the shadow economy as comprised of businessmen
who choose to operate informally to avoid costs, time and effort of formal registration
(Demsetz, 1974; De Soto, 1989, 2000; Schneider and Dominik, 2000). This school of
thought considers low institutional quality (such as bad governance, weak legal system,
heavy burden of regulations, high corruption, ineffective rules of law…) as the key
causes of working in the shadow economy. The shadow economy is considered as a
positive alternative to the formal economy. It is ―a site of resistance to the formal
economy that is growing‖ (Williams, 2012). By this approach, the participation in the
shadow economy is a choice, rather than a necessity, with three perspectives including
the neo-liberal perspective, green perspective, and post-capitalist theory.

       In the neo-liberal perspective, informal activities are attributed to hostile legal
system with cumbersome government rules and procedures. Responding to the lack of
free market space, people choose to take part in informal activities by bypassing
inappropriate legal regulations with easier informal norms, rules and laws. Neoliberal
theorists suggest that governments should simplify bureaucratic procedures to reduce
costs of becoming formality (registration, license) and remaining formality (taxes,
compliance with regulations and laws) for decreasing the size of shadow economy.

       Both green perspective and post-capitalist theory claim that people choose to
join in informal activities because they are dissatisfied with the negative sides of
                                           27




modern and capitalist free market, such as polarization and pollution. People seek for
an alternative economy which is more local, sustainable, environmental and
community-based.

2.1.1.2.4. The Voluntarist school with the theory of individuals‘ rational choice

       Another approach to the shadow economy is based on the theory of individuals‘
rational choice under uncertainty. Individuals respond rationally. They make choices to
maximize the utility. Their decision to work underground is similar. An individual
faces trade-off between gains if their informal activities are not exposed and losses if
disclosed and punished. If the expected benefits from working underground exceed the
formal costs and potential fines, individuals voluntarily participate in the shadow
economy. Schneider and Buehn (2016) theorize the shadow economy by individuals‘
rational choice approach in details with a structural equation. To this framework,
informal activities are negatively associated with the probability of detection and
potential fines (which determined by enforcement actions by the tax authority and
facilitating activities accomplished by individuals to avoid detection); and positively
associated with the opportunity cost of being formal (that determined by tax burden
and high labor costs). Followers of this approach are early named Voluntarists.

       The Voluntarist school looks at the shadow economy as comprised of
entrepreneurs who decide to operate in the informal economy to avoid taxes and social
security contributions (Tanzi, 1982, 1999; Schneider, 1994, 1997; Gile, 1999; and
Maloney 2004). These businesses are not willing to pay taxes. By operating
underground, they try to keep all economic profits for themselves. Being different from
Legalists, Voluntarists argue that entrepreneurs do not complain governments for
inconvenient rules and procedures, they voluntarily choose operating informally after
weighting costs of formality (payroll taxes and social protection contributions) and
benefits of informality (earning income while avoiding costs of formality). To
                                          28




Voluntarists, governments should expose informal businesses to formal environment to
increase the tax and competitiveness.

2.1.1.2.5. The school of complementary theory and shadow economy

       Different from legalists and voluntarists, who view the shadow economy as an
alternative for the official economy, scholars argue that shadow economy and official
economy are complementary in that they grow or decline in tandem. This view is
advocated by Adam and Ginsburgh (1985), Jensen et al. (1995), and Williams &
Round (2008). They find that those who are better-off have more chances to earn
informal income while lowest-income households are the least likely to report informal
activities. Greenfield (1993) sees the development of the informal and formal sectors in
a parallel way, with the notion that the direct and indirect demand for goods and
services produced in the informal sector will increase its size as the formal economy
expands. The positive relationship between formal and informal economies is due to
the advantages from the informal economy such as social cohesion through mutual aid
and reciprocity, social networks of material support, provision of goods and services to
those in need…

       Besides, another approach to the shadow economy is one based on the context
of work (International Labour Organization, 2002; and Losby et al., 2002). A person
who is self-employed or works for someone else can be categorized into contexts of
work as depicted in the table 2.2.

(Source: Adapted from International Labour Organization, 2002: 12-13; and Losby et
al., 2002: 4).

      In summary, the five dominant schools of thoughts on shadow economy have
their own pros and cons. Dualists view the shadow economy as a residue or a social
marginality that appears when laborers migrating from rural area to urban area cannot
fully be absorbed in the industrial sector. Two reasons for rising shadow economy are
the imbalanced rates between population growth and industrial employment, and the
mismatch between people‘s skills and industrial requirements. By this approach, the
shadow economy is a survival for the poor and marginal population in the process of
industrialization and modernization. However, the Dualist school denies the linkage
between the shadow economy and the official one. This drawback from Dualists is
overcome by Structuralists who describe the informal sector as an integral part of the
formal sector. To the Structuralist school, the presence of shadow economy is a result
                                            30




of the structural nature of capitalism, industrialization, and globalization as well as the
labour market imperfections. The shadow economy composes of subordinated
economic units and workers to reduce costs of input and labor of large capitalist
companies, and thereby increase their competitiveness. By this approach, Structuralists
explain the participation in the shadow economy including not only street traders and
very small-scale producers, but also wide range of informal occupations and large
enterprises. Nevertheless, both Dualists and Structuralists admit that the engagement in
the shadow economy is a necessity rather than a choice, which then is opposed by
Legalists and Voluntarists. The Legalist school sees the informal activities as a
resistance to the formal economy with low institutional quality, and as a response to
modern and capitalist free market. By this view, shadow economy is an alternative to
the official economy. Although with the same approach of individual choices,
Voluntarists argue that entrepreneurs do not complain governments for heavy
regulations, they voluntarily choose operating informally after weighting costs of
formality and benefits of informality. Different from Legalists and Voluntarists, who
view the shadow economy as a substitute for the official economy, scholars of
complementary theory argue that shadow economy and official economy are
complementary in that they grow or decline in tandem. The positive relationship
between formal and informal economies is attributed to: i) the advantages from the
informal economy such as social cohesion, social network, and spending of informal
income in the formal economy; ii) the increase in demand for goods and services
produced in the informal sector coming from expansion of official economy. Many
empirical studies have been done for the past decades, basing on the above various
schools of thought on shadow economy.

2.1.2. Empirical studies on shadow economy

       Previous studies on shadow economy concentrate on three main problems:
methods to measure the size of shadow economy, determinants of shadow economy,
and its impacts on other variables.

2.1.2.1. Methods to estimate the size of the shadow economy

    The hidden nature of the shadow economy makes it difficult to measure. There are
three major approaches widely used to assess the size and development of the shadow
economy, including direct methods, indirect methods and lastly the model methods.

    First, direct approaches include methods that are based on microeconomic theories
to employ well-designed surveys, tax auditing or other similar compliance methods.
This approach was used for estimating the shadow economy in Norway by Isachsen et
al. (1985), in Denmark by Mogensen et al. (1995), in Germany by Haigner et al.
(2013)… By this approach, the information about shadow economy activities and the
structure of labor in the shadow economy can be gained in details. However, the results
from this approach depend on how the questionnaires are formulated and how
respondents are willing to cooperate in interviews. Most of them often hesitate to
confess their hidden jobs. Moreover from this approach, the size of shadow economy
may be estimated in the short-run point, but not in the longer period of time. For the
above disadvantages, the results of the shadow economy from direct methods are
clearly lower-bound in comparison with other approaches.

    Second, indirect approaches, so called ―indicator‖ approaches, include methods
that are based on macroeconomic indicators containing information about the
development of the shadow economy over time. There are five indirect indicators
proposed for the estimation of shadow economy, including the discrepancy between
national income and expenditure statistics, the discrepancy between the official and
                                           32




actual labor force, the transaction, the physical input or electricity consumption, and
the currency demand. The advantages and disadvantages of the above indicators are
legibly discussed by Schneider and Buehn (2017).

   i)     The discrepancy between national income and expenditure statistics is an
          indicator to measure the shadow economy size because total income must be
          equal to total expenditure in measuring Gross national product (GNP). This
          indicator is used by Smith (1985) and Thomas (1999). It is a good method if
          all the components on the expenditure side are computed without errors.
          However, mistakes are unavoidable in the process of national account
          statistics, and most national statisticians tend to minimize this discrepancy
          before publication. Thus, this method may face of questionable reliability.
   ii)    The discrepancy between the official and actual labor force can be used to
          measure the shadow economy size (Contini, 1981). If the total labor force
          participation is constant, a decline in official labor participation rate can be
          seen as an indicator of underground activities. Nevertheless, this method has
          its own disadvantages. For example, differences in the rate of participation
          may be caused by other reasons and people can supplement their income by
          moonlighting (have the official job and also work underground).
   iii)   The transaction method was elaborated by (Feige, 1979, 1989). Basing on
          Fisher quantity equation: M*V = P*T (with M money, V velocity, P prices,
          and T total transactions), Feige (1979) assumed that total value of
          transactions P*T equals total nominal GNP (official + unofficial). Then the
          unofficial GNP can be calculated by subtracting official GNP from total
          nominal GNP. However, the main weakness of this method is the
          assumption of a constant relationship between the transactions and official
          GNP over time. Moreover, it is not convincing for the assumption that the
                                        33




      underground economy is the only factor influencing on the money quantity
      in transactions.
iv)   The physical input or electricity consumption method was developed by
      Kaufmann and Kaliberda (1996) and Lackó (2000). Kaufmann and
      Kaliberda (1996) showed that electricity-to-GDP elasticity is approximately
      close to one, indicating the positive one-one relationship between electricity
      consumption growth and GDP growth. Therefore, the difference between
      official GDP growth and electricity consumption growth is the increasing
      shadow economy. Simplicity and appealingness are the strength of this
      method, but the weakness is also inevitable. For example, not all activities in
      the shadow economy use electricity but other resources such as oil, gas,
      coal… Thus, only a part of the shadow economy can be estimated by this
      method. In addition, technical progress leads to use electricity more
      efficiently, minimizing the difference between official GDP growth and
      electricity consumption growth.
v)    The currency demand method was first proposed by Cagan (1958) in his
      work to find out key factors of money demand (tax rate, per-capita income,
      and the interest rate). Then Tanzi (1983) extended Cagan‘s work to estimate
      the currency demand and used the result to measure the size of the shadow
      economy in the United States during 1930–1980. This method is also
      employed by Alm & Embaye (2013) to measure the shadow economy size
      for 111 countries over the period of 1984–2006. Measuring the shadow
      economy basing on the currency demand approach stems from the idea that
      transactions in the shadow economy are paid in cash to avoid governments‘
      control, and the growth of the shadow economy leads to the increase in
      currency demand. Therefore, the difference of currency demand between
      low tax rate and higher tax rate reflect the size of shadow economy. By this
                                            34




          way, the shadow economy size can be estimated for a long period. However,
          this method faces several criticisms (Alm & Embaye, 2013). First, the
          method may not capture all shadow economy activities with the assumption
          from the approach that all transactions in the shadow economy are paid in
          cash. Second, most studies consider high taxes as the only one cause of the
          shadow economy while many causes of shadow economy (such as labor
          market regulations, the complexity of tax system, tax morality, and welfare
          benefits ) are not examined due to unavailable data for all countries. Third,
          the velocity of money in official and that in shadow economies are different
          in reality (because they depend on the income elasticity of cash demand) but
          they are assumed the same in most studies by the currency demand
          approach.

    Third, the model approach comprehensively considers multiple determinants
(causes) and multiple effects (indicators), instead of focusing on a particular side of the
phenomenon as the previous approaches do. One of the most popular models used to
estimate the shadow economy is the MIMIC approach (Multiple Indicators Multiple
Causes). By this way, the shadow economy (unobserved or latent variable) can be
measured through a set of observed variables (causes and indicators of the shadow
economy). The MIMIC approach consists of two simultaneous parts. The first one,
known as a measurement model, links the unobserved variable (the shadow economy)
to observed indicators. The second one, called the structural equation model, specifies
causal relationship between shadow economy and observed causes. The MIMIC
approach is employed to estimate the size of shadow economy by many scholars such
as Giles and Tedds (2002); Schneider and Bajada (2003); Bajada and Schneider (2005),
Buehn and Schneider (2012); Vo and Pham (2014), Hassan and Schneider (2016),
Schneider and Buehn (2017); and Medina & Schneider (2018)… Many causes of the
                                           35




shadow economy distinguished in these studies include tax and social contribution
burdens, regulatory burden, unemployment rate, self-employment rate, institutional
quality, and tax morality. The size of the shadow economy is reflected in various
indicators such as the official economic growth, currency/cash outside banks, and labor
force participation rate.

    It is commonly accepted by most scholars that there is no best method in
comparison with the MIMIC approach for its several dominant advantages (Schneider
and Buehn, 2017). First, the MIMIC approach offers a wider approach since it takes
many causes and indicators of the shadow economy into account. Second, this
methodology allows wide flexibility in its application when the choice of causal and
indicator variables can be changed to fit with particular features of the shadow
economic activity studied. Third, formal estimation and testing procedures can be
achieved by this model approach. Thus, this research will use the data of shadow
economy size estimated by Medina & Schneider (2018) by the MIMIC approach in
which many causes (including government size, regulatory burden, unemployment,
GDP per capita, trade openness) and effects (consisting of currency demand, labor
force participation rate, and GDP per capita growth) were taken into consideration. The
estimation procedure is described above.

2.1.2.2. Determinants of the shadow economy

    Burdens of taxes and social security contributions

    To Voluntarist school of thought, the rising burdens of taxes and social security
contributions are considered one of the most essential causes for the increase of
shadow economy. The higher the taxes, the smaller the after-tax earnings, and the
stronger the incentive to work in the shadow economy to reduce the tax wedge. This
positive relationship is concluded by Feige (1989), De Soto (1989), Tanzi (1982,
                                          36




1999), Gile (1999), Schneider & Bajada (2003), Schneider (2007, 2010), and Hassan &
Schneider (2016). However, some countries with high institutional quality can
experience a large tax base but not large shadow economy because taxpayers are
willing to pay the taxes when get better goods and services from the state (Johnson,
Kaufmann, & Zoido-Lobaton, 1998; Friedman et. al., 2000). The ‗tax morality‘
(citizens‘ attitudes toward the state as a moral obligation to pay taxes) is negatively
associated with the size of shadow economy (Alm & Torgler, 2006; Feld & Frey, 2007;
Torgler & Schneider, 2009; and Schneider, 2010).

    Intensity of Regulations

    Legalists debate that burdens of regulations and procedures induce the rise of
shadow economy. For example, over-regulations on labor market (minimum wages,
limited official working hours) or trade barriers (import quotas) increase labor costs
and structural unemployment, and reduce individuals‘ choice in the official economy.
This leads to higher motivation to work underground. The conclusion that heavily
regulated burden causes larger shadow economy is found from various studies
including those by Loayza (1996), Friedman et al. (2000), and Schneider et al. (2010).

    Corruption

    The nexus between corruption and shadow economy is theoretically ambiguous.
On one hand, many researchers such as Johnson et al. (1997), Hindriks et al. (1999),
Hibbs and Piculescu (2005), and Dreher & Schneider (2010) have a common
conclusion from their empirical studies that corruption and the shadow economy are
complements. To these scholars, corruption increases the size of shadow economy
because: i) corruption is viewed as a particular form of regulations and taxation which
are drivers of shadow economy (Johnson et al., 1997), ii) inspectors collude with
taxpayers for getting bribes in exchange of underreporting the tax liability of the
                                            37




taxpayers (Hindriks et al., 1999), and iii) businesses bribe dishonest bureaucrats for
ignoring their unofficial production activies (Hibbs and Piculescu, 2005). On the other
hand, the view that corruption and the shadow economy are substitutes is supported by
Choi and Thum (2005) and Dreher et al. (2008). These authors argue that the option to
go underground of businesses will reduce corrupt officials‘ ability to ask for a bribe.

    Unemployment, self-employment and retirement

    It is supposed in most schools of thought on informal economy that unemployment
rate has a positive impact on the shadow economy because high unemployment rate
gives individuals more incentive to work unofficially to earning a living. This
significant positive relationship is confirmed by Boeri & Garibaldi (2002), and
Dell'Anno & Solomon (2008). However, Tanzi (1999) implicates that the impact of
unemployment on the shadow economy is ambiguous since informal labor force can
heterogeneously include not only the officially unemployed, but also the retired and
those who work both officially and unofficially. The negative impact of unemployment
on the shadow economy is supported by Giles and Tedds (2002) with the justification
that the unemployment is negatively related to the growth of the official economy
(Okun‘s law) and the shadow economy tends to increase with the growth of the official
economy. To Okun‘s law, 1% increase in the unemployment rate will lead to 2%
decrease in a country's GDP. The fall in GDP reduces the shadow economy as
explained by the complementary theory. Besides, the shadow economy growth is
attributed to the increase of self-employment and retirement (Dell‘Anno, Gomez-
Antonio, & Pardo, 2007; Williams, Horodnic, & Windebank, 2016).

    Institutional quality/ public sector services

    The quality of public institutions is another important driver of shadow economy
under the view of Legalists. Higher quality of public institutions such as good rule of
                                          38




law, regulatory quality, government effectiveness securing contract enforceability and
property rights reduces transaction costs and increases benefits of remaining formal.
Conversely, a bureaucracy with lower institutional quality, such as high level of
corruption and regulatory burden, acts as barriers for businesses and individuals to be
official and pushes them participate in the unofficial economy. The negative impact of
institutional quality on shadow economy is empirically confirmed by Johnson et al.
(1998); Friedman, Johnson, Kaufmann, & Zoido-Labton (2000); Fugazza & Jacques
(2003); Torgler & Schneider (2009); Dreher, Kotsogiannis & McCorriston (2009);
Dreher & Schneider (2010); Singh et al. (2012); Razmi et al. (2013); and Hassan &
Schneider (2016).

    Development of the official economy

    The effect of official economy on informal sector is ambiguous (Schneider &
Bajada, 2003; Schneider & Dominik, 2013; and Vo & Pham, 2014). To dual approach,
the economic growth negatively affects shadow economy because dualists view the
shadow economy as a residual or a by-product of the official economy and economic
growth is the cure for the shadow economy (La Porta and Shleifer, 2008, 2014;
Williams, 2008). Nevertheless, Elgin & Oztunali (2014) explore that higher GDP per
capita is correlated with the larger informal sector in countries with low institutional
quality. This explanation is a combination of both schools of Legalists and
complementary theory.

    The trade openness and the globalization

    The trade theory implies that trade liberalization causes an increase in the shadow
economy because it is more difficult to control economic activities happening in the
economy with higher level of trade openness. This postulation follows the view of
Structuralists. It is empirically proved by Johnson, Kaufmann & Zoido-Lobaton
                                            39




(1998). Fugazza and Fiess (2010) find a similar result with macro-level data but it is
not supported by micro-founded data. Moreover, Goldberg and Pavcnick (2003) find
no evidence for the correlation between trade openness and shadow economy in cases
of Brazil and Colombia.

    The impact of globalization on the shadow economy is also ambiguous. To
Structuralists, the globalization may increase the shadow economy in developing
countries because of consequence of globalization, including rising costs, more
challenges and higher competitiveness which may shift local small- and medium- sized
companies operate underground (Goldberg and Pavcnik, 2003; Bacchetta et al., 2009).
Nevertheless, this thought is opposed by the argument that the globalization reduces
the shadow economy size due to benefits generated from the globalization such as
productivity improvement (Melitz, 2003), more income, new job opportunities, labor
market deregulation (Potrafke, 2014).

    Urbanization

    To dualist school, urbanization is positive related to the shadow economy as the
shadow economy appears in the process of industrialization and urbanization when
migrants move from rural sector to urban sector (Safa, 1986). However, Elgin & Oyvat
(2013) assert that there is an inverted-U relationship between the level of urbanization
and the share of shadow economy. To their interpretation, the share of the shadow
economy rises in the early phase of urbanization due to several pull and push factors;
but it tends to fall in the latter phase when the impact of these pull and push factors are
reduced as a natural result of rural dwellers getting wealthier.

    In short, the drivers of shadow economy comprise of burdens of taxes and social
security contributions, intensity of regulations, unemployment, self-employment,
retirement, institutional quality, public sector services, the official economy
                                          40




development, trade openness, globalization and urbanization. However, the effects of
these factors on shadow economy can be different from various schools of thought. A
similar tendency is also observed in the studies on the impacts of shadow economy on
social-economic indicators.

2.1.2.3. The impacts of the shadow economy

       The shadow economy has both negative and positive effects on social-economic
indicators,   examined   by   macroeconomic       approaches   (cross   countries)   and
microeconomic approaches (firms and laborers).

       Distortions of national accounts, allocation of resources, and tax revenue

       The rising shadow economies suggest that national accounts data is on average
significantly underestimated (Schneider & Bajada, 2003). The informal activities
actually operate, but it is not recorded in official economic indicators of the formal
economy such as national income, growth rate, unemployment, inflation…

       The presence of shadow economy also distorts the allocation of resources, alters
income distribution and reduces governments‘ tax revenue (Alm & Embaye, 2013).
Moreover, Loayza (1997) found the evidence that in time of rise of the underground
economy the availability of public services for everyone in the economy decreased, and
as result economic growth weakens. This explanation is closely related to the notion
that the shadow economy decreases government income which leads to less capacity to
provide public goods with high quality, thus decreases quality of life. This postulation
is in accordance with schools of Legalists and Volutarists who view the shadow
economy as a substitute for the formal economy.
                                           41




       Unfair competition

       A study by the McKinsey Global Institute (Farrell, 2004) shows that informal
companies can offset their low productivity and small scale by their lower overall cost
burden gained from avoiding taxes and regulations. These inefficient informal firms
still stay in business and prevent more productive, formal companies from gaining
market share. It is an evidence of unfair competition, a consequence of the shadow
economy that is commonly agreed by most schools of thought on informality.

       Impact of the informal economy on the labour market

       A survey conducted by Voinea and Liviu Albu (2011) indicates that 31.4% of
the total employed population is involved in informal employment in Romania. They
also reveal two important highlights: ―youths aged 15–24 are twice as likely to be
involved in the informal sector as older people‖; and ―the risk of being entrapped in the
informal sector is 12 times higher for people with a low level of educational
attainment‖.

       The shadow economy reduces the costs of labor, contributing directly to the
profitability of capital (Castells & Portes, 1989). This advantage in turn leads to the
labor absorption in the shadow economy (Portes & Benton, 1984). However, the
shadow economy with it natures (such as unprotected workforce, small units of
production, multiple intermediaries between laborers and capital…) will undermine the
formal organized labor market, contributing to the de-collectivization of the labor
process (Castells & Portes, 1989).

       To standard economic theory of dual labor markets, a rising formal minimum
wage increases structural unemployment and shifts surplus workers from the formal
sector to the informal one, increasing labor supply and lowering wages in the informal
sector. However, Boeri et al. (2011) find the reverse pattern: a minimum wage hike
                                           42




leads to an increase in informal salaries in developing countries in Latin America. This
is due to not only that the level of ―fair remuneration‖ has increased after a minimum
wage hike, but also that the skill composition of workers and sorting accounts arise.

       The effects of shadow economy on the productivity

       To Legalists and Voluntarists, the effect of shadow economy on the productivity
seems to be negative. As mentioned above, many authors make uniform of informal
activities with low productivity (Friedman et al., 2000; Ihrig & Moe, 2004; and La
Porta & Shleifer, 2014) by two reasons: less advanced production technologies are
used in underground activities and most of them are service activities connected to
consumer services. By definition, it is easier and less capital required by choosing
entering informal sector, in other words, informal sector is a collection of low
productivity activities. Thus, the shadow economy cannot help improve productivity.
Moreover, many factors of the productivity gap between formal and informal firms
have been studied, including the lack of access to markets, public services, and credit
by informal firms (Straub, 2005; Perry et al., 2007), small-scale informal firms (Perry
et al., 2007). Using a survey of 48,000+ small firms in Brazil, De Paula and
Scheinkman (2011) also find that informal firms pay no taxes, but face a higher cost of
capital, limited scale, lower capital–labor ratio and lower entrepreneurial ability in
comparison to formal firms.

       The effects of shadow economy on economic growth

       The effects of shadow economy on economic growth have been controversial
for a long time. On the one hand, many researchers from schools of legalists and
voluntarists (with the alternative theory of shadow economy) contend that the rising
shadow economy hinders economic growth as this sector causes a reduction in the
availability and efficiency of public services (De Soto, 1989; Loayza, 1997; Johnson et
                                         43




al., 1997), and a low productivity (Friedman et al., 2000; Ihrig & Moe, 2004; Porta &
Shleifer, 2014).

       On the other hand, other authors (from complementary theory) argue that the
shadow economy is positively associated with the official economy because an
expansionary fiscal policy from the government stimulates not only the official
economy but also the shadow economy (Adam & Ginsburgh, 1985). Furthermore, Nabi
and Drine (2009) conclude that the extra products from the shadow economy can help
increase the official economy. To Schneider and Dominik (2000), at least two thirds of
the income earned in the informal economy is immediately spent in the official
economy. The positive contribution of the shadow economy to the economic growth
via increasing consumers‘ expenditure is also confirmed by Bhattacharyya (1993).

       The effects of shadow economy on poverty

       Kim (2005) shows a positive relationship between the poverty and informal
economy participation in Romania, implying that the informal participation is driven
by low-income households with the motivation to escape from poverty. However, De
Martiis (2014) finds a negative impact of poverty on shadow economy in 33 OECD
countries. Nikopour & Habibullah (2010) conclude that the shadow economy decreases
poverty in developed countries but increases poverty in developing countries through
government expenditure and economic growth.

       Besides, some studies examine the impacts of shadow economy on other
variables such as fiscal and monetary policies, macroeconomic volatility, inflation,
quality of life, and pollution. Specifically, Castillo & Montoro (2007) show that the
presence of informal labor market can lessen the pressure of demand shocks on
aggregate wages and inflation, indicating that the interest rate channel of monetary
policy is relatively weaker in economies with higher level of shadow economy.
                                           44




Bandaogo (2016) finds that the shadow economy decreases the optimal tax rate,
increases macroeconomic volatility, increases countries‘ incentive to expand existing
currency unions. Kireenko & Nevzorova (2015) demonstrate an interrelationship
between shadow economy and quality of life through some indicators such as life
expectancy at birth and children in-school rate. Additionally, the shadow economy also
adds to the rising pollution as the informal firms do not have the access to financial
means for employing green technology (Biswas et al., 2012).




2.2. Shadow economy, FDI, and institutional quality

2.2.1. FDI and institutional quality

       2.2.1.1 Theories on FDI

       To IMF (1993) and OECD (1996), FDI is defined as an investment involving a
long-term relationship and reflecting a lasting interest and control by a resident entity
in one economy in an enterprise resident in an economy other than that of the
foreign direct investor. Many theories exploring the presence and incentives of FDI can
be grouped on macro and micro levels.

       One of the earliest FDI theories on macro level was proposed by MacDougall
(1958) and subsequently developed by Kemp (1964). According to MacDougall- Kemp
Hypothesis, capital freely moves from capital-intensive countries to capital-scarce but
labour-intensive countries to increase total welfare from the efficient use of resources
until the marginal productivity of capital is equalized between the two countries. The
Gravity model – another macro approach to FDI – is an application of international
trade theory. It states that the higher FDI between two countries will be if they are
closer in terms of geographical distance, culture, and economic size including
                                         45




population, GDP, endowments of labour, land or capital (Tinbergen, 1962). The
Dynamic Macroeconomic FDI theory focuses on macro environments as important
determinants of FDI. Macroeconomic environments encompass domestic investment
(Anwar and Nguyen, 2010; Lautier and Moreaub, 2012), market size (Kravis and
Lipsey, 1982; Hoang, 2012; and Liu, 2012), the exchange rate (Froot & Stein, 1991;
Grosse and Trevino, 1996), the real interest rate (Grosse & Trevino, 1996; Cavallari &
d'Addona, 2013), trading openness (Aizenman and Noy, 2006; Liargovas and
Skandalis, 2012); and macro stability (Kamin and Rogers, 2000; Husain et al., 2005;
Recep, 2009; and Anwar and Nguyen, 2010).

      If macro theories stand on the national level to formulate FDI theories, micro
FDI theories base on the perspective of businesses or industries. Being considered the
typical scholar of micro FDI theories, Hymer (1976) contended that a multinational
firm invests abroad when it has an oligopolistic power in an imperfect market for
profit-maximization. Oligopolistic powers may be technological innovation, superior
management, brand name, or/and patents. However, this notion is earlier implied by
Caves (1971) with Vertical, horizontal and conglomerate FDI theory. Furthermore,
Vernon (1966) used the Life cycle theory to explain the relationship of product life
cycle and possible FDI flows. To this theory, most of the new products are initially
manufactured in the country that invents it and are exported to other countries. But
when new products are widely accepted in the world market, production starts to take
place in other countries. The most likely outcome is that the product will then be
exported back to the country that invents it. Meanwhile, Buckley and Casson (1976) –
well-known with the Internalization theory – explain that the manipulation of the
transactions within the firm to minimize losses motivates the development of trans-
national companies.
                                          46




      One of the most comprehensive theories of FDI is Eclectic paradigm (or OLI
theory), proposed by Dunning (1980). The theory is the combination of microeconomic
theory and firm behavior as well as macroeconomic theory and trade. To the theory,
reasons for NMCs‘ localization are generated from several advantages, consisting of
Ownership (O), Location (L) and Internalization (I). Ownership refers to the privileges
that an MNC possesses such as knowledge, management skills, patents, brand, and
technological progress. Location implies production places that are close to final
consumers with good infrastructure, cheap inputs, low transport costs, political and
institutional environment, and government regulations. Internalization is the efficient
operation that an MNC is allowed to choose for the mode of entry in a host country
including the rights to transfer the specific capital or to reveal the proprietary
information inside an MNC. So far, Dunning's OLI model is arguably the most
complete explanation for FDI.

      FDI has also attracted a great deal of attention in development economics for
recent decades. Most studies on FDI focus on the determinants of FDI and its impacts
on the host economy. Many traditional determinants of FDI have been examined such
as market size (Kravis & Lipsey, 1982; Hoang, 2012; and Liu, 2012); domestic
investment (Anwar and Nguyen, 2010; Lautier & Moreaub, 2012); human resources
(Schneider & Frey, 1985; Moore, 1993; Wang & Swain, 1995; Brainard, 1997; Wei,
2010); labor with skills (Broadman, 1997; Coughlin, 2000); labor cost (Schneider &
Frey, 1985; Wheeler & Mody, 1992; and Loree & Guisinger, 1995); infrastructure
(Wheeler & Mody, 1992; Loree & Guisinger, 1995; Asidu, 2002; and Lumbila, 2005);
trading openness (Aizenman & Noy, 2006; Liargovas & Skandalis, 2012); macro
stability (Kamin & Rogers, 2000; Husain et al., 2005; Anwar & Nguyen, 2010; and
Recep, 2009); the real interest rate (Grosse & Trevino, 1996; Cavallari & d'Addona,
2013); the exchange rate (Grosse and Trevino, 1996; Froot & Stein, 1991; and
                                            47




Cavallari & d'Addona, 2013); and natural resources (Asiedu, 2006; Aleksynska &
Havrylchyk, 2013). The institutional quality is also considered an important factor of
FDI (Campos and Kinoshita, 2003; Kang, 2004) out of the above factors.

       2.2.1.2 Theories of institutional quality

       North (1990, 1991, 1994) is one of the first scholars who emphasizes the
importance of institutions. He defines institutions as formal rules (e.g. constitutions,
laws and regulations) and informal constraints (norms of behavior, conventions and
self-imposed codes of conduct). Kaufmann et al (1999) measure institutional quality by
the quality of governance comprising of six indicators: Voice and Accountability,
Political Stability and Absence of Violence, Government Effectiveness, Regulatory
Quality, Rule of Law, and Control of Corruption. This thesis focuses on such formal
institutions. A number of studies have found various determinants of institutional
quality such as: trade openness (Ades & Tella, 1999; Treisman, 2000; Kandil, 2009;
and Fukumi & Nishijima, 2010); democratization, political instability (Lederman,
Loayza, & Soares, 2005; Adsera, Boix, & Bayne, 2003); income (La Porta, Lopez-de-
Silanes, Shleifer, & Vishny, 1999); development level (Chong & Zanforlin , 2000;
Alonso & Garcimartin, 2013); education (Glaeser, La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, &
Shleifer, 2004; Alonso & Garcimartin, 2013); income distribution inequality (Alesina
& Perotti, 1996; Engerman & Sokoloff, 1997; You & Sanjeev, 2005); growth (Lipset,
1959; Barro, 1997); natural resources (Sachs & Warner, 1997; Easterly & Levine,
2003; and Alonso & Garcimartin, 2013).

       The quality of public institutions affects not only economic growth and
performance (North, 1990, 1991, 1994) but also other variables such as FDI and
shadow economy. The relationship between institutional quality and shadow economy
will be later discussed in the section 2.2.2. This part focuses on investigating the
institutional quality as an important determinant of FDI.

       2.2.1.3 The relationship between institutional quality and FDI

       The relationship between institutional quality and FDI through multinational
corporations (MNCs) has been early explored by Dunning (1980), North (1990) and
Westney (1993) through the three main theoretical frameworks as follows. First,
Dunning (1980) uses the Eclectic Paradigm, also known as the OLI-Model or OLI-
Framework, to explain the various reasons why an MNC enters into a host country. To
him, a MNC decides to invest in the host country when advantages of OLI (Ownership,
Location, and Internalization) are met. In this context, governance and institutions can
be seen as a location factor that may encourage or deter the investment inflows (see
Figure 2.1). Second, North (1990) shows that institutions set ―the rule of the games‖
which organizations and MNCs must follow in pursuit of their own learning and goals
for resource allocation. To him, institutions affect uncertainty level and allow
individuals and firms interact effectively. To attract investments, governments improve
their governance to lower transaction costs in which investors might get higher
profitability. Third, Westney (1993), by using a framework of institutionalization
theory, explores the potential significant role of MNCs in improving the organizational
patterns in host countries through subsidiaries.

      Figure 2.1. The place of institutions in the FDI determinants pattern.

      Source: Eclectic paradigm/OLI framework (Dunning, 1980)

      It is seen that theories proposed by Dunning (1980), North (1990) and Westney
(1993) suggest better governances and institutions are positively associated with FDI
inflows. However, He (2006) with the Pollution Haven Hypothesis contends that the
motives of some FDI firms are to find a place to hide pollution, and developing
countries with lax environmental regulations is the destination for these businesses. By
this view, low institutional quality will attract polluting FDI firms. What is the nexus
between FDI and institutional quality in Asian context? Does it follow the combination
of Eclectic Paradigm (Dunning, 1980), the Institutionalization Theory (North, 1990)
and NMCs theory Westney (1993), or the Pollution Haven Hypothesis (He, 2006)?
                                          50




      2.2.1.3.1. The impact of institutional quality on FDI

      There are at least three reasons supporting the view that the institutional quality
attracts FDI. First, good institutions, such as property rights and rule of law, improve
the allocation of resources and productivity prospect, and increase incentives to invest
(Kaufmann et al., 2002; Rodrik et al., 2004; and Acemoglu et al., 2005). Second, poor
governance or poor institutional environment endures uncertainty to which FDI is
vulnerable because of high sunk cost. For example, uncertainty caused by weak
contract enforcement reduces future returns and negatively affects FDI as a result.
Third, poor institutional quality such as corruption (Shleifer and Vishny, 1993; Wei,
2000) or criminality (Daniele and Marani, 2011) increases the cost of doing business
and therefore discourages FDI.

      Therefore, the institutional determinant of FDI has received a growing attention
in the recent literature. On one hand, most of studies find that FDI inflows are
significantly affected by some aspect of the host‘s institutions such as corruption and
transparency (Zhao, Kim, & Du, 2003); private ownership of business, banking sector
reform, and trade liberalization (Bevan, Estrin, & Meyer, 2004); corruption, risk and
foreign exchange rate (Grosse & Trevino, 2005); the market creating (Fabry & Zeghni,
2006); democratic accountability (Busse & Hefeker, 2007); intellectual property rights,
degree of government intervention in business operations, government corruption, and
contract enforcement (Du, Lu, & Tao, 2008); privatization and political uncertainty
(Trevino, Thomas, & Cullen, 2008); propriety rights (Ali, Fiess, & MacDonald, 2010);
democracy (Asiedu & Lien, 2011); organized crime (Daniele & Marani, 2011);
governance (Buchanan, Le, & Rishi , 2012); property rights and low default risk
(Gwenhamo & Fedderke, 2013); economic freedoms, state fragility, political rights,
and civil liberties (Tintin, 2013), property rights and social trust (Meon & Sekkat,
2014); government stability and low expropriation risk (Sanchez-Martın, Arce, &
                                           51




Escribano, 2014); corrupt and politically unstable distances (Lucke & Eichler, 2015);
corruption and level of institutional quality (Abotsi, 2016); property rights and
contracting institutions (Xu, Voon, & Shang, 2016)… In general, it is found that single
aspects of institutional quality have positive impacts on attracting FDI inflows.

       However, the new argument, especially in the case of China‘s outward FDI, that
the low institutional quality attracts higher FDI inflow (Fan, Morck, Xu, & Yeung,
2009), supporting the Pollution Haven Hypothesis (He, 2006).

       On the other hand, some authors find no positive or linear evidence between
FDI and some single aspects of institutional quality. For example, Bellos & Subasat
(2011) surprisingly concludes that corruption does not deter FDI in 15 transition
countries. Farla, Crombrugghe, & Verspagen (2014) reveal no evidence of a positive
relation between ―good governance‖ and higher levels of investment, and the
interaction between foreign investment and governance has a negative mediating effect
on total investment. Iloie (2015) proves that there is no clear evidence to support the
linkage among FDI, corruption perception index, and country risk assessments. Kurul
(2017) concludes that institutional quality does not positively affect FDI until this
measure exceeds a certain threshold value. Kandil (2009) finds no evidence for
suggesting that improvement in institutional quality is a major factor in attracting FDI
flows to MENA countries.

       2.2.1.3.2. The impact of FDI on institutional quality

       The effect of institutional quality on FDI has attracted many studies as above
depicted. Nevertheless, there are limited studies with regard to the impact of FDI on
institutional improvement in the literature. Larrain and Tavares (2004) find that FDI, as
a share of GDP, significantly reduces corruption levels. Furthermore, Kwok and
Tadesse (2006) illustrate the negative impact of MNCs on institutional improvement,
                                            52




measured by corruption, in the host countries, through three avenues: regulatory
pressure effect, demonstration effect, and professionalization effect.

       On the provincial level, Dang (2013) shows that FDI positively affects local
institutions (measured by indicators from PCI - provincial competitiveness surveys-
including competitive level, business regulations, accountability and property rights)
across 60 provinces in Vietnam, and that FDI inflows have greater institutional impacts
on the Northern provinces compared to those on the national performance. Meanwhile,
Long, Yang & Zhang (2015) provide firm level empirical evidence that the presence of
FDI has positively affected the institutional quality (measured by the tax & fee burden
and the quality of rule of law experienced by Chinese domestic firms) of the host
regions in China, and FDI has helped Chinese regions improve their institutional
environment for domestic firms…

       There are some channels that researchers believe through which FDI could
potentially affect the institutional quality in the host country. First, foreign investors
may force local leaders for institutional reform by threatening to leave, taking away the
employment and tax revenue (Malesky, 2008). Second, foreign investors can provide
local leaders with helpful information on laws and regulations in their countries and
others that they operate their business (Prakash & Potoski, 2007). Third, higher FDI
inflows can make local authorities more autonomy to implement institutional
innovation policies (Malesky, 2008; Dang, 2013). Fourth, FDI reduces corruption by
promoting competition (Ades & Di Tella, 1999). Fifth, FDI helps enhance property
right protection in the host country (Ali, Fiess, & Macdonald, 2011). Finally, the
presence of FDI improves local institutional quality through lower tax and fee burden
and better rule of law (Long, Yang & Zhang, 2015).

       2.2.1.3.3. Bidirectional relationship between FDI and institutional quality

       Bidirectional relationship between FDI and institutional quality is nearly
ignored except a few. Hyun (2006) shows a long run relationship between institutional
quality and FDI, and the causality is bidirectional in 62 developing countries covering
the period 1984-2003, by using Autoregressive-distributed lag model (ADL) and Error
correction model (ECM). Research results by Fukumi & Nishijima (2010) indicate that
FDI can improve the quality of institutions, while better institutions attract more FDI
into Latin America and the Caribbean. Shah, Ahmad, & Ahmed (2015) suggest that
there is long-run bidirectional causality between institutions and aggregate FDI, as well
as services and manufacturing (but not primary) FDI in Pakistan, the short-run causal
relation only between institutional quality and manufacturing FDI is confirmed while
no causal relation among institutional quality and FDI in primary and services sectors.

       In general, previous studies on relationship between FDI and institutional
quality have some limitations as follows. First, previous studies mainly focus on
institutions of the host countries as one of the key determinants of the location of FDI.
However, the role of FDI in improving institutional quality in host countries is scarcely
investigated. Especially, the numbers of studies on bidirectional relationship between
two variables are negligible. Second, research studies often employ some single aspects
of institutional quality in each paper such as: corruption, transparency, democracy,
property rights…to test the impact of institutions on FDI. Many aspects of institutional
quality should be taken into consideration to have a comprehensive analysis of FDI-
institutional quality nexus. Third, research contexts include panels of developing
countries, transition economies, former communist European Countries, Latin America
and the Caribbean, South Africa, Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and North
Africa (MENA); single countries such as: Italy, China, India, Pakistan, Vietnam... but a
panel of Asian countries has not been examined.
                                           54




       In the above backdrop, this research will install a broad set of institutional
indicators to evaluate the bidirectional relationship between FDI and institutional
quality in Asian countries. This bidirectional relationship is an important issue to be
studied because both of FDI and institutional quality are regarded as forces of
economic growth and development (Borensztein, Gregorio, & Lee, 1998; Rodrik,
Subramanian, & Trebbi, 2004; and Acemoglu, Johnson, & Robinson, 2005). The study
on the bidirectional relationship is expected to facilitate our understanding of the way
these determinants interact to foster economic growth. Moreover, expected results from
the study hopefully provide policy-makers with empirical evidences for their decision-
making in Asian countries.

       Basing on the Eclectic Paradigm (Dunning, 1980), the Institutionalization
Theory (North, 1990), NMCs theory (Westney, 1993), and previous studies as
mentioned above, I contemplate that:

       Hypothesis 1: Better institutional quality in the host countries helps attract
FDI inflows and FDI inflows improve institutional quality in the host countries.

2.2.2. Institutional quality and shadow economy

       Different from Dualists and Structuralists who view the shadow economy as a
residue or a by-product of the official economy for marginal and survival people, both
Legalists and Voluntarists consider informal activities as a choice rather than a
necessity. To Voluntarist school, people choose work in the informal sector to avoid
paying taxes and social security contributions (Tanzi, 1982, 1999; Schneider, 1994,
1997; Gile, 1999, Maloney 2004). This view is correlated with tax evasion activities.
Voluntarists argue that entrepreneurs do not complain governments for heavy
regulations, they voluntarily choose operating informally after weighting costs of
formality (payroll taxes and social protection contributions) and benefits of informality
                                            55




(way to earn income while avoiding costs of formality). Meanwhile, Legalists contend
that people participate in the shadow economy to avoid costs, time and effort of formal
registration (Demsetz, 1974; De Soto, 1989, 2000; and Schneider & Dominik, 2000).
This school of thought considers low institutional quality - such as bad governance,
weak legal system, heavy burden of regulations, high corruption, and ineffective rules
of law - as the key causes of working in the shadow economy. To Legalists, people
work underground because they complain governments for inconvenient rules and
procedures. In other words, to legalist approach, the shadow economy is a result of low
institutional quality.

         It is argued in the literature that higher quality of public institutions such as
good rule of law, regulatory quality, government effectiveness securing contract
enforceability and property rights reduces transaction costs and increases benefits of
remaining formal. Conversely, a bureaucracy with lower institutional quality, such as
high level of corruption and regulatory burden, acts as barriers for businesses and
individuals to be official and pushes them participate in the unofficial economy. The
impact of institutional quality on shadow economy in previous studies is reviewed as
below.

         2.2.2.1 The effect of institutional quality on shadow economy

         Most of studies conclude a negative effect of institutional quality on shadow
economy, supporting the schools of Legalists. For example, basing on a data set from
the OECD, Latin America, and transition economies, Johnson, Kaufmann and Zoido-
Lobaton (1998) reveal that more corruption and weak rule of law are causes for larger
shadow economy size. They argue that lax regulations and weak rule of law without
effective supervision allow officials corrupt, leading to more enterprises operating in
shadow economy. Similarly, Friedman et al. (2000) conclude that poor institutions
(such as more bureaucracy, greater corruption, and a weaker legal environment) and ―a
                                             56




large unofficial economy go hand in hand‖ by using data for 69 countries. Torgler and
Schneider (2009) also find that improving institutional quality (especially the legal
structure and security of property rights) and higher tax morale can lessen the incentive
to ―go underground‖ and reduce the size of shadow economy. Better institutional
quality leading to a smaller shadow economy and reduces corruption is confirmed by
Dreher, Kotsogiannis & McCorriston (2009). Meanwhile, Fugazza & Jacques (2003)
conclude that labor market regulations and tax burden are the reasons for informal
activities. They support the view that policies should aim at promoting individuals
benefits of participating in the formal sector than a deterrence policy because they find
the effect of the interaction between formal and informal activities on standard
outcome of governments‘ intervention.

       Moreover, the shadow economy is affected not only by institutional quality but
also by the gap between the formal and informal institutions. For example, by using the
2013 Eurobarometer survey involving 27,563 face-to-face interviews across 28
European countries, Williams, Horodnic & Windebank (2015) show that the greater is
the asymmetry between the formal and informal institutions, the higher is the
propensity to engage in the shadow economy at the individual-, population group- and
country-level because of bigger gap between state morality and individual morality.

       Further, Elgin and Oztunali (2014) examine the relationship between level of
economic development and shadow economy by taking institutional quality into
consideration for 141 countries over the period from 1984 to 2009. They find that
institutional quality strongly interacts with this relationship. Particularly, a higher level
of GDP per-capital is related with a larger shadow economy size in the case of low
institutional quality, and a smaller shadow economy size in the case of high
institutional quality. This result stresses on the important role of institutional quality in
determining whether the shadow economy and the official economy are substitutes or
                                           57




complements: without the improvement in institutional quality, the growth of official
economy cannot reduce the shadow economy and vice versa.

       2.2.2.2 The effect of shadow economy on institutional quality

       The effect of shadow economy on institutional quality is still a gap in the
literature. However, some studies imply interesting hints. Loayza (1997) found the
evidence that in time of rise of the underground economy the availability of public
services for everyone in the economy decreased and activities using the existing public
services less efficient increased. Moreover, the extension of shadow economy reduces
the tax revenue (Kodila-Tedika & Mutascu, 2013) and the falling tax revenue decreases
government income which leads to less capacity to provide public goods with high
quality (Broms, 2011).

   In short, most of studies on the nexus between institutional quality and shadow
economy concentrate on institutional quality as a driver of shadow economy, basing on
Legalism school of thought on the informal economy. Following this view, better
institutional quality reduces the shadow economy because of two reasons: i) better
institutional quality lessens the burden of regulations and procedures - the main cause
that explain why people participate in informal activities - and thus lowers shadow
economy (Demsetz, 1974; ii) better institutional quality reveals informal transactions
which consequently turn official and hence reduces shadow economy (De Soto, 1989,
2000). The negative impact of institutional quality on shadow economy is empirically
confirmed by Johnson et al. (1998), Friedman et al (2000), Fugazza & Jacques (2003),
Torgler & Schneider (2009), Dreher et al. (2009), Dreher & Schneider (2010), Singh et
al. (2012), Razmi et al. (2013), and Hassan & Schneider (2016). There is no study on
the feedback effect of shadow economy on institutional quality. However, this
theoretical and empirical gap needs to be filled for 2 reasons: i) if the feedback effect
of shadow economy on institutional quality is found, Legalism theory may be modified
                                          58




in the view that institutional quality is not only the cause but also the consequence of
shadow economy; and ii) studies on this relationship should take the endogeneity
problems into consideration. To fill this gap, I argue that shadow economy reduces the
tax revenue and falling tax revenue diminishes government income which leads to less
capacity to provide public goods with high quality.

      Therefore, I argue that:

      Hypothesis 2: There is a negative bidirectional linkage between institutional
quality and the shadow economy.



2.2.3. Shadow economy and FDI

      To the best of my knowledge, the relationship between FDI inflows and shadow
economy in the host country is largely ignored in the literature except three studies by
Nikopour et al (2009), Davidescu & Strat (2015) and Ali & Bohara (2017). The result
from Nikopour et al (2009) indicates that higher FDI reduces shadow economy.
However, Nikopour et al. (2009) do not explain through which channels that FDI can
negatively affect shadow economy. Similarly, Davidescu & Strat (2015) find a
negative unidirectional short-run causality that runs only from FDI to the shadow
economy in the case of Romania. Meanwhile, Ali & Bohara (2017) confirm that higher
shadow economy increases FDI inflows since MNCs take advantages of tax evasion in
host countries with higher size of shadow economy. However, the bidirectional nexus
between FDI and shadow economy and the channels of the nexus are still theoretical
and empirical gaps. The gaps need to be further re-examined for both theoretical and
empirical aspects for 2 reasons. First, it is imperative to research through which
channels that FDI can affect shadow economy as well as shadow economy can affect
FDI. Second, policy makers in Asia will be provided by empirical results to deal with
                                           59




FDI and shadow economy simultaneously whereas FDI inflows contribute to economic
growth (Borensztein et al., 1998; Nair-Reichert & Weinhold, 2001; and Hansen &
Rand, 2006), but shadow economy is regarded as one of the major threats of
development (Friedman et al., 2000; Ihrig & Moe, 2004; Alm & Embaye, 2013; and
Porta & Shleifer, 2014). Next hypotheses are going to fill the above gaps.

      2.2.3.1 The effects of FDI and FDI-institutional quality interaction on shadow
economy

      FDI can hypothetically help reduce the size of shadow economies through three
channels. First, FDI helps improve institutional quality (Larrain & Tavares, 2004;
Kwok & Tadesse, 2006; Dang, 2013; and Long et al., 2015), and better institutional
quality in turn reduces shadow economy (Johnson et al, 1998; Friedman et al., 2000;
Fugazza & Jacques, 2003; Torgler & Schneider, 2009; Dreher et al., 2009; Dreher &
Schneider, 2010; Singh et al., 2012; Razmi et al., 2013, and Hassan & Schneider,
2016). Second, FDI contributes to the official economic growth (Romer, 1994; Choe,
2003; Li & Liu, 2005) and official economic growth reduces the size of unofficial
economy (La Porta and Shleifer, 2008, 2014; Williams, 2008). Third, FDI creates
employments (Lall, 1995; Blomström et al., 1997) and rising wages (Heyman et al.,
2007), which lower shadow economy size (Boeri & Garibaldi, 2002; and Dell'Anno &
Solomon, 2008).

      2.2.3.2 The effects of shadow economy on FDI

      The impact of shadow economy on FDI is still neglected in the literature except
a couple of work. Nikopour et al. (2009) explore that higher shadow economy causes
higher FDI because large shadow economy is accompanied with low tax revenue and
higher budget deficit, and to compensate for the falling tax revenue governments give
more privilege to foreign investors to attract FDI. Similarly, Ali & Bohara (2017)
                                          60




confirm that higher shadow economy increases FDI inflows since MNCs take
advantages of tax evasion in host countries with higher size of shadow economy.
However, I postulate that shadow economy negatively affects FDI because high
shadow economy leads to low institutional quality and low institutional quality
discourages FDI.

   Taking institutional quality into the bidirectional relationship between FDI and
shadow economy is the contribution of this thesis in the literature by combining the
three theories including international trade, institutionalization and Legalism. It is
argued that FDI can reduce shadow economy through the channel of institutional
quality improvements resulted from FDI inflows; and higher shadow associated with
lower institutional quality which may discourage FDI inflows. In addition, the
interaction of FDI and institutional quality helps reduce the shadow economy. Besides,
FDI inflows may have potential impacts on shadow economy by other channels such as
creating jobs and increasing the official economic growth.

      Thus, I hypothetically formulate that

      Hypothesis 3: There is a negative bidirectional nexus between FDI inflows
and shadow economy.

      Hypothesis 4: The interaction of institutional quality and FDI is negatively
associated with the shadow economy.

   As argued above, though FDI, institutional quality and shadow economy are inter-
correlated and even inter-dependently, their three-way linkages remain the gaps in the
literature. The gaps are imperative to be filled in because of two reasons. First,
studying on this mutual relationship formulates the mechanism in which these variables
interact to foster economic growth, by using an integrative approach of combining
three relevant theories. Second, this study contributes to the theoretical literature by
                                           61




showing the linkage among the three theories: international trade, institutions and
shadow economy by an integrative approach. Third, FDI, institutional quality and
shadow economy attract great attention from policies makers because all of them are
closely associated with economic growth and development (Borensztein, Gregorio, &
Lee, 1998; Nair-Reichert & Weinhold, 2001; Rodrik, Subramanian, & Trebbi, 2004;
Acemoglu, Johnson, & Robinson, 2005; Hansen & Rand, 2006; Varsakelis, 2006;
Kandil, 2009; Schneider, 2003, 2010; and Vo & Pham, 2014). The demonstrated
results of their mutual relationship indicate that policies to tackle any one of them can
affect the other two at the same time, and governments need empirical evidences to
consolidate their policy-making on dealing with these aggregate variables
simultaneously.




2.3. Shadow economy and income inequality

2.3.1. Income inequality

2.3.1.1. Definition

    There are various definitions of income inequality. In general, income inequality
refers to ―the extent to which income is distributed unevenly in a group of people‖ (The
Equality Trust, 2016). More specific, income inequality is the unequal distribution of
income across the various participants in an economy; and income is defined as
―household disposable income in a particular year‖ which includes wages, capital
income, self-employment income, public cash transfers, social security contributions
and income taxes paid by households are deducted (OECD, 2017). According to the
World Bank (2017a), income inequality is the extent to which the distribution of

coefficient. This research employs the above definition and Gini coefficient from the
World Bank.

2.3.1.2. Theories

       In economics, the income distribution theory focuses on two main aspects: i)
personal distribution (distribution of income among individuals); ii) functional
distribution (distribution of income among factors – land, labor, and capital). This
section reviews income distribution and inequality through various schools of
economics.

       The classical theory of distribution

       The theory on income distribution is initially mentioned by well-known
classical economists such as Adam Smith (in Wealth of Nations, 1776) and David
Ricardo (in Principles of Political Economy and Taxation, 1817). Both Smith and
Ricardo recognize three factors of production (land, labor and capital) and divide the
―wages fund‖ into three categories: ―rent‖ for landowners, ―wages‖ for workers and
―interest‖ for capitalists. However, they have different views on workers‘ wages. To
Smith, workers‘ wages are only a part in the value of outputs they produce. Although
Smith sees a high degree of economic inequality as an inevitable result of capitalism
and such a certain inequality as a positive mean to encourage productivity and to
bolster political stability, he supports wage efficiency because high wages are also a
motivation for improving productivity. Nevertheless, Ricardo contends that wages are
at ―subsistence‖, just enough to keep workers and their families alive. In his research,
the diminishing marginal profit drives profits to zero in the agricultural sector and there
is a surplus of laborers. The expanding industrial sector absorbs this labor force surplus
from the agriculture without increasing wages. As a result, income inequality increases
in the process of economic growth.
                                           63




       Karl Marx’s theory of income distribution
       Basing on classical theorists‘ framework, Marx (1867) in his book named
―Capital‖ assumes that there are two classes in the modern society: the proletariat
(workers) and the bourgeoisie (the owners of the means of production). To Marx,
workers are paid enough to afford food and a place to live, without consciousness of
being exploited by the owners. Marx shows that the private ownership of means of
production is the key cause of unequal distribution of wealth. When the rich becomes
richer and inequality of distribution is higher, workers will be conscious of being
exploited. They unite and rise up in a global revolution. After the revolution, the world
will become communism when workers own means of production. No one powerfully
controls the access of wealth and then everything will equally distributed amongst all
people.


       The neoclassical (or marginalist) distribution theory
       Neo-classical economics concentrates on supply, demand, factor pricing and
distributive shares in competitive market structure, basing on individual profit- and
utility-maximization, represented by Alfred Marshall (Principles of Economics, 1890)
and others such as John Bates Clark, William Stanley Jevons, John Stuart Mill, Leon
Walras, Carl Menger and Joan Robinson. Neoclassical theorists argue that incomes are
determined by the values of production factors contributing to the total product. Clark
(1889, 1891) proposes the marginal product theory to solve the difficulty of separating
the contributions of the various inputs. Clark points out that in an optimal status the
interest rate is equal to the marginal product of capital, while the wage equals the
marginal product of labor. To get the optimum, the profit-maximizing producer will
continue renting capital and hiring labor as long as the interest rate is lower than the
marginal product of capital and the wage is lower the marginal product of labor
                                            64




respectively. By this way, the contribution of each factor to total product is separately
computed. Then the price of each factor can be determined by the supply and demand
in each factor market, while the demand for each factor is derived from the demand of
final goods that each factor is used for production.
       The neoclassical income distribution theory has two main advantages. First, the
income distribution theory and production theory are combined. Second, factor returns
(rent, wages and interest) are calculated in the same way, not in different ways as
classical theory does. However, the theory is criticized on its assumption: constant
return to scale. To researchers this assumption is not unrealistic for countries as a
whole. However, it does not hold for particular industries in which some have economy
of scale and some have diseconomy of scale.


       Post-Keynesian theory of income distribution
       The Post-Keynesian theory of income distribution was developed by Robinson,
Kaldor, Pasinetti and other Cambridge economists in the 1960s, basing on the central
proposition of Keynes' theory of output and employment. To the proposition of
Keynes' theory, the level of output and employment as a whole is determined by the
amount of investment. The Post-Keynesian theory expands Keynes' theory to contend
that investment affects not only output and employment, but also the national income
distribution between wages and profits (Kregel, 1978). While the orthodox theories
(such as the classical theory and the neo-classical theory) explain unequal income on
basis of differential productivity and the difference between wages and profits; the
Post-Keynesian theory highlights the important role of investment, growth,
employment, and prices in the distribution of national income.
       In Summary, the orthodox theories (the classical theory, Karl Marx‘s theory and
the neoclassical theory) explain unequal income by microeconomics approach while
                                              65




the Post-Keynesian theory uses macroeconomics to interpret the presence of income
inequality.
       + To the orthodox theories, income distribution is determined by the prices of
products and factors of production that each individual can sell, and differential
productivity. Thus, income inequality is due to differences in initial factor endowments
or/and imperfections in the market mechanism. However, this approach is criticized on
its ignorance of institutional, social, and historical factors.
       + The Post-Keynesian theory demonstrates that income inequality is a result of
social and political custom and decisions, as well as market power. The theory shows
the interdependence amongst growth, distribution, and prices.


2.3.1.3. Measurements

       To OECD (2017), income inequality can be measured by five indicators. First,
the Palma ratio is the disposal income share of the top 10% people (highest income)
divided by that of the bottom 40% people (lowest income). If the Palma ratio is one or
below, the society is more equal, meaning that income held by the top 10% does not
exceed that by the bottom 40%. The Palma ratio may be as large as 7 in very unequal
societies. Second, S90/S10 is the ratio of the average income of the 10% richest to the
10% poorest, describing inequality between the top and the bottom. Third, P90/P50 is
the ratio of the upper bound value of the ninth decile (i.e. the 10% of people with
highest income) to that of the median income, indicating inequality between the top
and the middle. Fourth, P50/P10 is the ratio of median income to the upper bound
value of the first decile, showing inequality between the middle and the bottom. Last,
the Gini coefficient, or index, is the most popular measurement of income inequality. It
was developed by the Italian statistician and sociologist Corrado Gini in 1912. The
Gini index ―measures the extent to which the distribution of income or consumption
                                          66




expenditure among individuals or households within an economy deviates from a
perfectly equal distribution‖ (The World Bank). The Gini coefficient measures the
percentage of the area between a Lorenz curve and the hypothetical perfect equality
line to the maximum area under the line. A Lorenz curve graphs the cumulative
proportion of total income or wealth earned against the cumulative number of earners,
starting with the lowest-income individual or household. Thus, a Gini index of 0
indicates perfect equality - or everyone has the same income; while an index of 100
represents perfect inequality - one person takes home 100% of the income. The Gini
index is employed to measure income inequality in this study.

      2.3.1.4. Determinants

      To the view of the classical theory, Karl Marx‘s theory and the neoclassical
theory, changes in income inequality may be thought of as a result of changes in the
distribution of assets in society which then are determined by the ownership
distribution of land, capital, education and technology. Over time, this ownership
distribution is formulated by many factors developed by The Post-Keynesian theory
such as household savings, investment decision, educational spending, political factors,
the quality of institutions, the effectiveness of governance, technological progress,
economic freedom, and globalization.

      Several empirical studies have explored the drivers of income inequality all over
the world. The drives can be grouped into various categories. The first group includes
macroeconomic variables such as GDP growth (Kuznets, 1955), inflation (Mocan,
1999) and unemployment (Rice and Lozada, 1980; Blejer and Guerrero, 1990). The
second group is fiscal actions, consisting of size of government, government
expenditure, and subsidies (Tanninen, 1999; Dupont and Martin, 2006). The third
group covers institutional quality and political factors, containing corruption,
governance, democracy and political freedom (Reuveny and Li, 2003; Chong and
                                             67




Gradstein, 2007; and Carmignani, 2009). The fourth group stands for economic factors
such as globalization, openness of the economy, economic freedom and foreign direct
investment (Wood, 1997; Spilimbergo et al., 1999; Barro, 2000; Alderson & Nielsen,
2002; Rosas, 2007; and Chintrakarn et al., 2012). The fifth group is education,
comprising years of schooling, secondary and tertiary education, and unequal
distribution of education (Winegarden, 1979; Knight & Sabot, 1983; O‘neill, 1995; and
Gregorio & Lee, 2002). The last but not least group encompasses factors of natural
resources, land distribution and initial distributions of assets (Deininger & Squire,
1998; Fum & Hodler, 2010; and Bergner, 2016).

       Research on the determinants of income equality in Asia has been less, not to
mention the study of specific factors in Asian developing countries. The most
comprehesive study about determinants of income inquality in Asia has been
conducted by Zhang, Kanbur and Rhee (2014). Co-authors point out technological
progress, globalization, and market-oriented reformm - three engines of the rapid
growth in Asia in the last two decades, as unfortunately causes of income inequality in
the continent through capital, skill, and spatial biases.

       This paper contribute to the literature by using cross-country panel data
regression to examine a various set of determinants of income inequality in Asian
developing countries, especially taking the impact of shadow economy into particular
consideration.

2.3.2. The impact of shadow economy on income inequality

    Studies on shadow economy often focus on developing countries because many
scholars assume that informal activities are alternative solutions to poverty and
unemployment temporarily and thus will disappear when industrial sector grows larger
that can absorb the surplus labor from rural sector (Marcelli et al., 1999). This thought
                                            68




on shadow economy follows the Dualist school that represented by Hart (1973),
Sethuraman (1976), and Tokman (1978). Dualists with residual theory view the
shadow economy as encompassed by informal activities that generate income for the
poor and provide a safety net in times of crisis. The Dualist school of thought implies a
relation between the shadow economy and poverty reduction – an indicator for
lessening income inequality. Meanwhile, Legalists and Volutarists with alternative
theory view the participation in the shadow economy is a choice, rather than a
necessity, to avoid taxes and social security contributions, creating unfair competition
for businesses and employees between informal and formal sectors (Chen, 2012). By
this approach, formal sector can be negatively affected by the informal sector.

    Despite many studies focusing on the shadow economy or income inequality
separately, the relationship between these two variables has been less investigated and
remains tentative, except some efforts.

    The first published papers dealing with this issue are those by Rosser et al. (2000,
2003). By macroeconomic approach of using empirical data for 16 transition
economies between 1987 to 1989 and 1993 to 1994, co-authors conclude with caution
that there is a positive relationship between the degree of income inequality and the
size of the informal economy. An increase in inequality causes more informal activities
due to the decline in social solidarity and trust, and expanding informal activities lead
to more inequality because of falling tax revenues and weakened redistributive
policies. Nevertheless, this causal relationship remains untested and unknown because
Rosser et al. (2000) just use statistical methods of scatter grams to optically see the link
of two variables.

    Further studies of literature seem to concentrate on elucidating the role of income
distribution in determining the size of shadow economy by macro-econometric
analyses. Most of them show positive impacts of inequality on the shadow economy.
                                          69




For example, Winkelried (2005) argues that higher income inequality in Mexico leads
to a large informal sector relying on a channel whereby inequality affects the behaviour
of aggregate demand, and that redistribution towards the middle class can reduce the
size of informal sector. Similarly, Chong and Gradstein (2007) conclude a positive
impact of inequality on shadow economy by the argument that when inequality
exacerbates, in conjunction with weak institutions, the rich invest in rent seeking more
and the poor invest less. Dell‘Anno (2016a) also finds the positive effect of inequality
on the shadow economy.

       However, attempts to investigate the impact of shadow economy on income
inequality are still scarce, excluding some relevant studies. By micro approach of
including the regional share of non-observed economy (NOE) in a wage equation,
Valentini (2009) finds that the income evasion attached to NOE tends to reduce the
inequality measured by the regular wages in the specific case of Italian private sector
employees. This result is appropriate with Smith‘s (2002) hypothesis that the shadow
economy creates jobs for the poor. Krstic and Sanfey (2011) argue that inequality
changes negligibly when informal unemployment rises significantly in the Serbian
labor market between 2002 and 2007, notwithstanding. To their results, informal
workers earn less much than those in the formal economy although informality plays a
rising essential role in explaining income inequality. Earlier, the important role of
shadow economy in improving poverty is mentioned in Kim‘s (2005) research. To this
author, the motivation for participating in the shadow economy in Romania is to escape
from poverty, and thus informal economic activities are used as salvage for the poor to
lessen poverty and contribute to reducing income inequality.

       Most recently, the link between shadow economy and income inequality has been
proposed through a theoretical framework by Dell‘Anno (2016b) as given in the figure
2.2.
                                           70




       Figure 2.2. The theoretical framework for the link between shadow
economy and income inequality – (Source: Dell‘Anno, 2016b)

    In the above framework, there are three kinds of effects: direct, indirect and
feedback ones. By direct effects, higher income inequality exacerbates the size of
informal economy by reducing human capital, physical capital, social capital and
institutional quality. By indirect effects, higher income inequality impedes the formal
economy and in turn expands informality in transition and emerging countries. By
feedback effects, higher informality may increase income inequality by deterring the
effectiveness of redistributive policies, or may decrease income inequality by
generating income opportunities for less fortunate social categories that otherwise are
unemployed because of entry barriers.
    In this study, we hope to contribute to the literature by filling the gap on the above
feedback effects of informal economy on income inequality. This research gap needs to
be fulfilled for two reasons. First, if this negative affect is demonstrated, the research
will extend theories in the context of Asian developing countries on the positive effects
of shadow economy. Second, the result may provide policy-makers with empirical
evidences that policies to deal with the shadow economy should take the poor into
close consideration with other simultaneous solutions for poverty eradication.
                                           71




    In the thesis, a cross-country panel data regression is employed to examine a
various set of determinants of income inequality in Asian countries, especially taking
the impact of shadow economy into particular consideration. We hypothesize the
negative effect of shadow on income inequality, basing on two theoretical points. First,
Dualists with the residue theory depict the shadow economy as a set of survival
activities performed in a marginal society, generating income for the poor (Hart, 1973;
Sethuraman, 1976; and Tokman, 1978). Although the classical theory of distribution
concludes that income inequality increases in the process of economic growth because
the expanding industrial sector absorbs the labor force surplus from the agriculture
without increasing wages; classical economists did not forecast that marginal people
who cannot be absorbed in the industrial sector may work underground, and increase
their income by this way. Thus the shadow economy is expected to increase the income
share of the poor and lessen the income inequality. Second, Legalists and Voluntarists
with the alternative theory of shadow economy contend that the rising shadow
economy creates unfair competition for businesses and employees between the formal
and informal sectors. Moreover, to dual approach, shadow economy attracts most of
the poor and small businesses, but not the rich and big businesses. Therefore, the rising
shadow economy can reduce the income share of the rich. As a result, the shadow
economy may lessen the income inequality in society in the context of Asia.
    In summary, I contend that:
    Hypothesis 5: Shadow economy negatively affects income inequality through
    the channels of increasing the income share held by lowest quintile, and
    decreasing the income share held by highest quintile.

    In conclusion, basing on relevant theories and previous studies, the author
hypothesizes that FDI and institutional quality are positively related; institutional
quality and shadow economy are negatively linked; there is a negative bidirectional
                                        72




nexus between FDI and shadow economy; the interaction of institutional quality and
FDI is negatively associated with shadow economy; and shadow economy helps reduce
income inequality by increasing income share held by the poorest 20% and decreasing
income share held by the richest 20%.

3.1. Analytical framework

       Basing on the theories of international trade and FDI, institutions, shadow
economy and income inequality, and previous studies, an analytical framework is
designed as given in the figure 3.1

Figure 3.1. The analytical framework for the relationship among FDI,
institutional quality, shadow economy and income inequality.

*(1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) stand for respective hypotheses.

       In the above analytical framework, there are five main relations amongst FDI,
institutional quality, shadow economy and income inequality: i) the bidirectional nexus
between FDI and institutional quality; ii) the bidirectional linkage between institutional
quality and shadow economy; iii) the bidirectional relationship between FDI and
shadow economy; iv) the effect of interaction between FDI and institutional quality on
shadow economy; and v) the impact of shadow economy on income inequality proxied
by three indicators including Gini coefficient, income share held by lowest quintile and
income share held by highest quintile.
                                           75




        First, the bidirectional nexus between FDI and institutional quality is
theoretically explored by Dunning (1980) with the OLI-Model, North (1990) with
institutional theory and Westney (1993) with institutionalization and MNCs theory.
This positive relation is empirically confirmed by Hyun (2006), Fukumi & Nishijima
(2010), and Shah, Ahmad, & Ahmed (2015).

        Second, the negative effect of institutional quality on shadow economy is based
on the two schools of thought on informal sector, including Legalist (Demsetz, 1974;
De Soto, 1989, 2000; and Schneider & Dominik, 2000) and Voluntarist (Tanzi, 1982,
1999; Schneider, 1994, 1997; Gile, 1999; and Maloney, 2004). Meanwhile, the effect
of shadow economy on institutional quality is still a gap in the literature. However, I
argue that the extension of shadow economy reduces the tax revenue (Kodila-Tedika &
Mutascu, 2013) and the falling tax revenue decreases government income which leads
to less capacity to provide public goods with high quality (Broms, 2011). As a result,
shadow economies negatively affect institutional quality.

        Third, the bidirectional relationship between FDI and shadow economy, and the
effect of interaction between FDI and institutional quality on shadow economy – the
research gaps - are proposed in this research due to theoretical and empirical reasons as
well as arguments as below:

   i)      FDI helps improve institutional quality (Larrain & Tavares, 2004; Kwok &
           Tadesse, 2006; Dang, 2013; and Long, Yang & Zhang, 2015); and better
           institutional quality in turn reduces shadow economy (Johnson, Kaufmann &
           Zoido-Lobaton, 1998; Friedman et al., 2000; Fugazza & Jacques, 2003;
           Torgler & Schneider, 2009; Dreher, Kotsogiannis & McCorriston, 2009;
           Dreher & Schneider, 2010; Singh et al., 2012; Razmi et al., 2013, and
           Hassan & Schneider, 2016).
                                          76




   ii)    FDI contributes to the official economic growth (Romer, 1994; Choe, 2003;
          and Li & Liu, 2005) and official economic growth reduces the size of
          unofficial economy (Dualist school of thought; Williams, 2008; and La Porta
          & Shleifer, 2008, 2014).
   iii)   FDI creates employments (Lall, 1995; Blomström, Fors and Lipsey, 1997)
          and increases wages (Heyman, Sjoholm and Tingvall, 2007) which lower
          shadow economy size (Boeri & Garibaldi, 2002; and Dell'Anno & Solomon,
          2008).
   iv)    Shadow economies negatively affect FDI because high shadow economy
          leads to low institutional quality and low institutional quality discourages
          FDI (author‘s arguments in the thesis).

   Fourth, I hypothesize the negative effect of shadow economy on income inequality
by combining three schools of thought on shadow economy, including Dualism,
Legalism and Voluntarism, with two theoretical points. First, Dualists with the residue
theory depict the shadow economy as a set of survival activities performed in a
marginal society, generating income for the poor (Hart, 1973; Sethuraman, 1976; and
Tokman, 1978). Thus the shadow economy is expected to increase the income share of
the poor. Second, Legalists and Voluntarists with the alternative theory of shadow
economy contend that the rising shadow economy creates unfair competition for
businesses and employees between the formal and informal sectors (Chen, 2012).
Moreover, to dual approach, shadow economy attracts most of the poor and small
businesses, but not the rich and big businesses. Therefore, the unfair competition from
shadow economy may reduce the income share of the rich. As a result, the shadow
economy may lessen the income inequality in Asia.

3.2. Empirical models and data
3.2.1. FDI, institutional quality and shadow economy

       To examine the three-way linkages between FDI, institutional quality and
shadow economy in Asian countries, the author uses the simultaneous equation panel
data model (Model 1) including three equations for three independent variables: FDI,
institutional quality and shadow economy.

3.2.1.1 The impact of institutional quality and shadow economy on FDI inflows

       Basing on studies by Dunning (1980), Hyun (2006), Fukumi & Nishijima
(2010), and Shah, Ahmad, & Ahmed (2015), the FDI equation taking institutional
quality and shadow economy into account is proposed as follows:

       FDIit = α0+ α1 INSTQUALITYit + α2 SHADOWit + αj Xi,t + εit (1)

Where: t: time; i: country; ε: error term; α1,2: respective coefficients of independent
variables; αj: coefficients of control variables.

- Dependent variable:

    Foreign direct investment (FDI): Net FDI inflows measured as the percentage of
       GDP, collected from World Development Indicators, World Bank (2017a).

- Independent variables:

    Institutional quality (INSTQUALITY): proxied by a composite institutional
       index, captured by five components (Voice and Accountability, Political
       Stability and Absence of Violence, Government Effectiveness, Regulatory
       Quality, and Rule of Law), collected from Worldwide Governance Indicators,
       World Bank (2017b)
                                           78




    Shadow economy (SHADOW): the country level of shadow economy measured
       as a percentage of official GDP, collected from the research by Medina &
       Schneider (2018).
    X is a vector of determinants of FDI, consisting of
       + Domestic investment (DI): proxied by Ratio of Gross capital formation in
       GDP, collected from WDI, World Bank (2017a).
       + Gross Domestic Products growth (GDPG): GDP growth rate, a proxy for
       development, collected from WDI, World Bank (2017a).
       + Human resources (LABOR): proxied by the labor force participation rate,
       collected from ILO.
       + Labor quality (LABORQUALITY): proxied by school enrollment, tertiary (%
       gross), collected from Institute for Statistics, UNESCO.

       The selection of the above control variables is based on theories of FDI and
previous studies on key determinants of FDI (discussed in section 2.2.1.1)

- Expected signs of the effects:

       Nishijima, 2010; and Shah, Ahmad, & Ahmed, 2015), GDP growth (Chowdhury

       2006; Aleksynska & Havrylchyk, 2013).
    FDI is negatively affected by SHADOW (Nikopour, Habibullah, Schneider and
       Law, 2010); and WAGE (Loree & Guisinger, 1995; Schneider & Frey, 1985;
       and Wheeler & Mody, 1992).
    The relation of DI and FDI is mixed, depending on ―crowding-in‖ or ―crowd-
       out‖ effects (Anwar and Nguyen, 2010; Buchanan et.al, 2012; Farla,
       Crombrugghe & Verspagen, 2014; Lautier and Moreaub, 2012).

       Following theory and studies by Dunning (1980), North (1990), Westney (1993)
Hyun (2006), Fukumi & Nishijima (2010), and discussion in section 2.2.2.2), the

quality and previous studies on key determinants of institutional quality (discussed in
section 2.2.1.2).

- Expected signs of the effects:

    The institutional quality is positively correlated with FDI (Larrain & Tavares,
       2004; Dang, 2013; and Long, Yang & Zhang, 2015); Democratization (Adsera,

    The institutional quality is negatively associated with shadow economy
       (Johnson et al., 1998; Friedman, et al., 2000).

3.2.1.3 The impact of FDI, institutional quality and their interaction on the shadow
economy

       Combining the theories of shadow economy, international trade and institutional
quality as well as previous studies on determinants of shadow economy, the impact of
FDI, institutional quality and their interaction on the shadow economy is depicted in
the following shadow economy equation:

SHADOWit = γ0 + γ1FDIit + γ2INSTQUALITYit + γ3FDIit *INSTQUALITYit + γjZit
+vit                                                                      (3)

       Stability and Absence of Violence, Government Effectiveness, Regulatory
       Quality, and Rule of Law), collected from Worldwide Governance Indicators,
       World Bank (2017b)
    The interaction of FDI and Institutional quality (FDI* INSTQUALITY)
    Z is a vector of other determinants of shadow economy, comprising of:

       The selection of the above control variables is based on theories of shadow
economy and previous studies determinants of shadow economy (discussed in section
2.1.1.2 & 2.1.2.2).

- Expected signs of the effects:

    The shadow economy is negatively affected by FDI (Nikopour, Habibullah,
       Schneider & Law, 2010); institutional quality (Fugazza & Jacques, 2003;
       Torgler & Schneider, 2007, 2009; Dreher, Kotsogiannis, & McCorriston, 2009;
       and Schneider, 2010); and the interaction of FDI and institutional quality.
    The shadow economy is positively correlated with the burden of government
       regulations (Friedman, Johnson, Kaufmann, & Zoido-Labton, 2000); tax burden
       (Johnson, Kaufmann, & Zoido-Lobaton, 1998; Schneider, 2003, 2007, 2010);
       Economic Freedom (Zarra-Nezhad, Hasanvand, & Akbarzadeh, 2014);
       unemployment (Dell‘Anno & Solomon, 2008); and retirement (Zarra-Nezhad,
       Hasanvand, & Akbarzadeh, 2014).
                                        84




 The shadow economy is ambiguously associated with the official economy
   (Schneider & Bajada, 2003; Schneider & Enste, 2013; and Vo & Pham, 2014);
   globalization (Goldberg & Pavcnik, 2003; Bacchetta et al., 2009; Melitz, 2003;
   Potrafke, 2014); corruption (Johnson et al., 1997; Hindriks et al., 1999; Hibbs &
   Piculescu, 2005; Dreher & Schneider, 2010; Choi & Thum, 2005; and Dreher et
   al., 2008); and urbanization (Safa, 1986; Elgin & Oyvat, 2013).
 The marginal effect of FDI on shadow economy, taking the interaction of FDI
   and institutional quality into account, in the equation (3) can be calculated as
   follows:



   The interaction of FDI and institutional quality indicates the role of institutional
   quality in determining the effect of FDI on shadow economy. There are four
   possibilities from examining this.


   (1) If γ1 and γ3 are both positive, then FDI has a positive impact on shadow
      economy, and the increase in institution quality intensifies this impact.
   (2) If γ1 and γ3 are both negative, then FDI has a negative impact on shadow
      economy, and the increase in institution quality intensifies this impact.
   (3) If γ1 is negative and γ3 is positive, then FDI negatively affects shadow
      economy and this effect diminishes with the improvement in institutional
      quality.
   (4) If γ1 is positive and γ3 is negative. There are two scenarios.
      / γ3/ > γ1: First, FDI has a positive impact of shadow economy, but then there
      is a threshold of institutional quality beyond which FDI can have negative
      impact on shadow economy.
                                                    85




            / γ3/ < γ1: FDI has a positive impact of shadow economy, and the increase in
            institutional quality reduces this impact.



3.2.2. Shadow economy and income inequality

     In order to estimate the effect of shadow economy on income inequality and to
confirm the determinants of income inequality in 19 Asian countries2, the following
linear model (Model 2) is adopted:
        INEQUALITYit = λ1 SHADOWit + δjVi,t + µi + εit (4)
                                                                    Where t: time; i: country

     Where Income inequality (INEQUALITY) is the dependent variable for country i
in year t, measured by three alternative indicators: Gini coefficient (Gini), income
share held by lowest 20% (lowest20), and income share held by highest 20%
(highest20) in three specifications (1), (2) and (3) respectively. Data for Gini
coefficient, income share held by lowest quintile, and income share held by highest
quintile are extracted from World Development Indicators (World Bank, 2017a).
     Shadow economy (SHADOW) is the independent variable, estimated as the
percentage of the official economy. The data for shadow economy is employed from
the estimations by Medina & Schneider (2018).
     λ1 is the marginal effect of shadow economy on income inequality; δj is a vector of
coefficients of control variables; µi denotes the country-specific fixed effects to control
for country-specific factors including the time-invariant component of variables used,
and ε is an error term. We expect that λ1 < 0 in specification (1) & (3), and λ1 > 0 in
specification (2) because it is hypothesized that shadow economy reduces Gini

coefficient and income share held by highest 20% , but increases income share held by
lowest 20%.
    V is a vector of control variables such as employment, inflation, trade openness,
institutional quality, economic freedom, education, corruption, and natural resources.
The selection of these control variables is based on previous studies and arguments as
follows.
    Employment and inflation: These two macroeconomic variables have certain
important impacts on income inequality in the literature. Rice and Lozada (1980) show
that the rise in the unemployment rate tends to increase the extent of income inequality
and that inflation tends to reduce the extent of such inequality. Similarly, Mocan
(1999) finds increases in structural unemployment have a substantial aggravating
impact on income inequality while inflation has a progressive impact. However,
arguments from Blejer and Guerrero (1990) indicate that underemployment, inflation,
and government spending worsen income distribution. We expect employment and
inflation have negative and positive impacts respectively on income inequality.
    Trade openness: To Heckscher-Ohlin theory, the effect of trade openness on
income distributions depends on factor endowments. Greater international trading
openness would raise inequality in rich countries and lower it in poor countries (Barro,
2000). The theory that greater openness to trade tends to narrow the wage gap between
skilled and unskilled workers in developing countries is also supported by Wood
(1997). Thus, it is expected that trade openness reduces income inequality in Asia
developing countries.
    Institutional quality: It is found that better institutional quality leads to a more
equal distribution of income (Chong and Gradstein, 2007) while weak institutions
increase income inequality (Carmignani, 2009) because the poor can be protected by an
independent judicial system. Therefore, it is hypothesized a negative relationship
                                           87




between institutional quality and income inequality with the expectation that the poor
can be protected by an independent judicial system.
    Economic freedom: The impact of economic freedom on income inequality has
been argumentative. Berggren (1999, 2003) explores that the increase in economic
freedom lessens income inequality in a cross-country data. Similar results are
confirmed by Scully (2002), and Ashby & Sobel (2008) at the US state level.
However, results from a study by Carter (2007) indicate the tradeoff between economic
freedom and equality: higher levels of economic freedom are significantly associated
with lower equality by reducing income redistribution toward the poor. Thus, the
impact of economic freedom on income inequality is ambiguous.
    Education: The Kuznets effect predicts a u-shaped relation between education and
inequality: the improvement in education initially causes higher inequality; but then
inequality reverses at a certain point when the group of high skilled expands (Knight
and Sabot, 1983). However, findings from various studies confirm that more years of
schooling, a proxy for education, and more equal distribution of education among
people improve the income distribution (Winegarden, 1979; Gregorio and Lee, 2002).
Moreover, O‘neill (1995) reveals that convergence in education levels in developed
countries has resulted in a reduction in income dispersion. A negative impact of
education on income inequality is hypothesized in this research.
    Corruption: Gupta et al. (2002) point out that high and rising corruption increases
income inequality and poverty through lower economic growth, poor targeting of
social programs, biased tax systems, and unequal access to education and public
services. Such a positive impact of corruption on income inequality is also concluded
by Gyimah-Brempong (2002) and Apergis (2010). Therefore, it is hypothesized
corruption positively affects income inequality.
    Natural resources: Initial distribution of assets and natural resources are major
sources of income inequality in many mostly agrarian countries (Deininger and Squire,
                                           88




1998). Fum and Hodler (2010) provide empirical evidence to support the hypothesis
that natural resources lessen income inequality in ethnically homogenous societies, but
raise income inequality in ethnically polarized societies. Nevertheless, Bergner (2016)
find no significant influence of natural resources on income inequality.
    A panel data of 19 Asian countries over the period 1990-2015 for all variables in
the equation (4) is collected from various sources. We employ the data for shadow
economy from the estimations by Medina & Schneider (2018); Education index from
Human Development Report, UNDP; Control of corruption from Worldwide
Governance Indicators (World Bank, 2017b); Institutional quality from Global
Competitiveness Index, World Economic Forum; Economic freedom index from the
Economic Freedom Report 2016, Fraser Institute. The remainders, consisting of Gini
coefficient, the income share held by lowest quintile, the income share held by highest
quintile, employment in services, inflation, trade openness, and land per capita are
collected from World Development Indicators (World Bank, 2017a).


3.3. Econometric methodologies

3.3.1. FDI, institutional quality and shadow economy
       Most of previous studies on the bidirectional nexus between FDI and
institutional quality use the Autoregressive Distributed Lag approach - ARDL, and the
Error Correction Model – ECM with the panel cointegration test (Hyun, 2006; and
Shah, Ahmad, & Ahmed, 2015). ARDL cointegration technique proposed by Pesaran
& Shin (1999) and Pesaran, Shin & Smith (2001) is in favor with 3 advantages. First,
ARDL does not need all variables must be integrated at the same order, the variables
can be stationary at level I(0), first difference I(1) or mix of both (Pesaran & Shin,
1999). Second, it can be used with time-series small sample data size (Hamuda et al.,
2013). Third, it can test the mutual relationship between FDI and institutional quality
                                           89




for both short-run and long-run with unbiased estimation because ECM can be derived
from ARDL model through a simple linear transformation (Harris and Sollis, 2003).
However, this approach is invalid when there are stationarity at second difference I(2)
and more than two interdependent equations (Pesaran, Shin & Smith, 2001).
       Meanwhile, empirical studies on the impact of institutional quality on the
shadow economy employ single linear equation model (Johnson, Kaufmann & Zoido-
Lobaton, 1998; Friedman et al., 2000; Torgler & Schneider, 2009; Dreher,
Kotsogiannis & McCorriston, 2009; and Fugazza & Jacques, 2003). However, the
above methods cannot deal with simultaneous relationship, especially the three-way
linkages between FDI, institutional quality and shadow economy. Thus, the non-
dynamic simultaneous model with three equations is used in this thesis as pertinent
solution for the first research objective - that is to examine the three-way linkages
between FDI, institutional quality and shadow economy in Asian countries.
FDIit = α0+ α1 INSTQUALITYit + α2 SHADOWit + αj Xit + εit
INSTQUALITYit = β0 + β1FDIit + β2SHADOWit + βjYit + uit
SHADOWit = γ0 + γ1FDIit + γ2INSTQUALITYit + γ3FDIit *INSTQUALITYit + γjZit + vit


       The above proposed model with three equations is a typical simultaneous
equations model (SEM) in macroeconomics. The possible features and problems of the
SEM are: i) contemporaneous correlation of errors across the structural equations, ii)
omitted variables in the structural equations, and iii) simultaneous or joint endogeneity
(some explanatory variables are dependent variables in the structural equations).
Technically, when each endogenous variable is solved through exogenous or
predetermined variables, a system of reduced form equations can be obtained. These
reduced form equations include no endogenous variables and satisfy all the
assumptions needed for the application of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). However,
structural coefficients depend on the estimates of reduced form coefficients. If the
structural parameters cannot be found from the estimates of reduced form parameters,
                                           90




the SEM is un-identified or under-identified (Griliches and Intriligator, 1983). Thus,
the option for appropriate estimation methods should take these problems into account.
       Econometrically, OLS cannot be used to estimate individual equations in the
SEM because it will be biased, inconsistent, and inappropriate (Zellner and Theil,
1962). Zellner and Theil (1962) proposed the Three Stages Least Squares (3SLS) as an
appropriate estimation method for the simultaneous equation model, especially when
the SEM is over-identified. 3SLS is a combination of Seemingly Unrelated Regression
(SURE) - also called Joint Generalized Least Squares (JGLS) - and Two Stage Least
Squares (2SLS). Its function is the sum of squared transformed fitted residuals. 3SLS
requires a process of three steps (Greene, 2012):
       (1) the reduced form equations are estimated from instrumented values for all
          endogenous variables to get predicted values for the endogenous regressors;
       (2) the structural equations are estimated from the predicted values to get
          residuals to estimate the cross-equation correlation matrix;
       (3) the Generalized Least Squares (GLS) estimation is performed from using the
          covariance matrix in the second stage and with the instrumented values in
          place of the right-hand-side endogenous variables.
       To Davidson and MacKinnon (1993), the 3SLS estimation is both consistent
(because it uses predicted endogenous dependent variables, like 2SLS) and efficient (it
takes into account the cross-equation correlation of disturbances, like SURE).
However, the 3SLS estimation method has some disadvantages (Schmidt, 1990). First,
3SLS is not computable when any equation fails the order condition for identification.
Second, 3LSL is sensitive to misspecification. Third, 3SLS is limitedly used for panel
data and dynamic dependent variables.
       Moreover, it is found from the literature that lagged levels of dependent
variables (including FDI, institutional quality and shadow economy) may affect their
current values (by Bandyopadhyay, Sandler & Younas, 2014; Kotschy & Sunde, 2016;
                                           91




Berdiev, Pasquesi-Hill & Saunoris, 2015 respectively). Thus, the model 1 is also
examined in the dynamic form as follows.
FDIit = α0+ α1 FDIi, t-1 + α2 INSTQUALITYit + α3 SHADOWit + αj Xit + εit
INSTQUALITYit = β0 + β1 INSTQUALITYi, t-1 + β2 FDIit + β3SHADOWit + βjYit + uit
SHADOWit = γ0 + γ1 SHADOWi, t-1 + γ2 FDIit + γ3 INSTQUALITYit + γ4FDIit
*INSTQUALITYit + γjZit + vit


       To estimate the above dynamic simultaneous equations model, the Generalized
Method of Moments (GMM) is used. There are two types of GMM, including the
Difference Generalized Method of Moments (DGMM) and the System Generalized
Method of Moments (SGMM). Both of them are designed for cases of with ―small T,
large N‖ panels, meaning few time periods and many individuals; independent
variables that are not strictly exogenous, meaning they are correlated with past and
possibly current realizations of the error; fixed effects; and heteroskedasticity and
autocorrelation within individuals (Roodman, 2009). DGMM is only applicable when:
i) untransformed errors have independent and identical distribution; and ii) orthogonal
variation of deviation is used to keep spherical matrix (Arellano and Bond, 1991).
However, Blundell and Bond (1998) show that if a dependent variable is closer to
random walk, the DGMM estimate will be less effective because past data contains less
information to predict changes in the future, and untransformed lags are not good
representatives for transformed variables in the model.
       To increase efficiency of the estimation, Blundell and Bond (1998) develop a
new approach called the SGMM estimation method, basing on the work of Arellano
and Bond (1991) and Arellano and Bover (1995) on GMM estimator. The SGMM can
perform with linear dynamic panel-data estimation to solve the problems of
endogeneity, heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation (Blundell and Bond, 1998). Two
types of tests will be used for the empirical model (Arellano and Bond, 1991). First, the
Sargan test checks the validity of instruments and specifications. Second, the Arellano
                                           92




and Bond test examines the hypothesis that the residuals from the estimations are first-
order correlated (AR1) but not second-order correlated (AR2).
       In short, the non-dynamic simultaneous equations model is estimated by 3SLS
while Two-step SGMM is employed for the dynamic simultaneous equations model.


3.3.2. Shadow economy and income inequality

    To examine the relationship of shadow economy and income inequality in
transition economies between 1987 to 1989 and 1993 to 1994, Rosser et al. (2000) use
statistical methods of scatter grams on Gini coefficient and percentage informal sector
share, as well as on changes in Gini coefficient and changes in percentage informal
sector share. Meanwhile, Valentini (2009) employ a random effect model through an
extended wage equation to investigate the effect of NOE to the inequality measured by
the regular wages in the specific case of Italian private sector employees.
    In this thesis, the equation (4) is estimated by using three ways of pooled ordinary
least squares (POLS), fixed effects (FE) and random effects (RE) to analyze the impact
of show economy on income inequality represented by Gini coefficient, the income
share held by lowest 20% and the income share held by highest 20%. To remove the
effects of country unobserved characteristics (µi), I apply fixed and random effects
estimations. Besides, the error term (εit) can have non-constant variance and can be
serially correlated and; therefore, I use the likelihood ratio test for heteroscedasticity
and the test for the serial autocorrelation by Wooldridge (2002). Finally, I carry out the
F-test (comparing FE and POLS) and the Hausman test (comparing FE and RE) to
choose the best appropriate estimation model for each proxy of income inequality.
    Furthermore, the 2-Step System GMM is also employed to check the robustness of
the estimation and to control endogeneity caused by the feedback effect of income
inequality on shadow economy. The SGMM can perform with linear dynamic panel-
                                          93




data estimation to solve the problems of endogeneity, heteroskedasticity and
autocorrelation (Blundell and Bond, 1998). Two types of tests will be used for the
empirical model (Arellano and Bond, 1991). First, the Sargan test checks the validity
of instruments and specifications. Second, the Arellano and Bond test examines the
hypothesis that the residuals from the estimations are first-order correlated (AR1) but
not second-order correlated (AR2).



3.4. The sample selection of 19 Asian countries and their backgrounds on research
problems

      19 Asian countries are selected, including: China, Mongolia, India, Bangladesh,
Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan.

      The selection of 19 Asian countries is owed to two reasons. First, all of these
countries belong to middle income countries (lower middle income with GNI per
capita between $1,006 and $3,955; or upper middle income with GNI per capita
between $3,956 and $12,235). High income countries and territories in Asia with GNI
per capita of $12,236 or more as defined by the World Bank (2018) such as Japan,
Singapre, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Australia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Macao, Oman,
Qatar and Saudi Arabia are excluded in the research. Second, the selection is also due
to data constraints. The data for shadow economy, institutional quality and income
inequality must be sufficient for econometric analysis. Studies based on crossed-
country analysis do not eliminate differences in many aspects such as culture,
population and correspondingly render the results dubious in nature because of data
comparability and heterogeneity problems (Deaton, 1989; Atkinson & Brandolini,
2001). However, the selection of 19 Asian countries is my best choice with data
                                           94




availability and possible minimization of heterogeneity problems. A brief analysis on
the context of research problems in 19 Asian countries is given as follows.

      Shadow economy size: Those countries whose size of shadow economy is above
the Asian average include Bangladesh, Cambodia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz, Malaysia,
Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand. The highest sizes of
shadow economy to GDP belong to Myanmar, Thailand and Sri Lanka with 51.39%,
50.63% and 45.58% respectively. Countries with lowest size of shadow economy are
China, Mongolia and Vietnam with 14.67%, 17.28% and 18.7% respectively. The
remainder (Bhutan, India, Indonesia, Laos, and Maldives) sees the size of shadow
economy around 20% -30% of GDP (Medina & Schneider, 2018).

      FDI: Until the end of 2015, three countries that attract most FDI net inflows
(current US$) are China, Indonesia and Vietnam with 242.4, 19.7 and 11.8 US$ billion.
Buhtan, Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka received least FDI with less than 1 US$ billion.
However, when the ratio of FDI to GDP is used to eliminate the different size of these
countries, top three of countries attracting FDI net inflows (% of GDP) are Kyrgyz
Republic, Laos and Cambodia with 17.1%, 9.9 % and 9.4% respectively. Nepal,
Bhutan, and Pakistan are correspondingly lowest with 0.2%, 0.5% and 0.6% (World
Bank, 2017b).

      Institutional quality:      In 2015, Malaysia and Bhutan are categorized in the
first group of high institutional quality in 19 Asian countries with institutional
composites of 0.41 and 0.37 respectively. The second group includes Mongolia, Sri
Lanka, India, Philippines, Maldives, Indonesia and Thailand with institutional
composites between – 0.12 and – 0.29. Kazakhstan, Vietnam, China, Laos, Cambodia,
Nepal, Kyrgyz Republic and Bangladesh are classified into the third group with
institutional composites around – 0.4 to – 0.8. Myanmar and Pakistan fall into the
                                          95




lowest group of institutional quality with institutional composites of below – 1. (World
Bank, 2017a).

      Income inequality: The average Gini coefficient in 19 Asian countries around
2012 is 35.85. The comparison between the two periods of mid-1990s and around-2012
shows that the average Gini index for 19 developing Asian countries decreases by
5.22%. This improvement in income inequality mostly came from Central Asian
countries such as Kyrgyz Republic, Kazakhstan, and Maldives. Gini indexes were also
seen falling in Cambodia, Thailand, Nepal, Malaysia and Mongolia. On the contrary,
China, Indonesia and India - covering 82% of the population in the region- experienced
a rapid rising income inequality with their increases in Gini indexes by 18.8%, 14.9%
and 14.1% respectively. The income inequality was also found rising in Sri Lanka,
Laos, Pakistan, Vietnam and Tajikistan. (World Bank, 2017b).

4.1. Introduction

      The contribution of FDI to the economy has been examined for various aspects,
such as providing an important physical capital for economic growth (Borensztein,
Gregorio, & Lee, 1998; Hansen & Rand, 2006); creating employment (Lall, 1995;
Blomström, Fors & Lipsey, 1997; Eckel C, 2003; and Fu & Balasubramanyam, 2005);
increasing productivity from spillover effects and technology transfers (Javorcik, 2004;
Newman, Rand, Talbot & Tarp, 2015), and improving institutional quality (Larrain &
Tavares, 2004; Kwok & Tadesse, 2006; Dang, 2013; Long, Yang & Zhang, 2015).
However, the linkage between FDI and informal economy remains the gap in the
literature. I argue that FDI inflows can reduce the shadow economy through following
channels. First, FDI improves institutional quality (Larrain & Tavares, 2004; Kwok &
Tadesse, 2006; Dang, 2013; and Long, Yang & Zhang, 2015); and higher institutional
                                          97




quality discourages informal activities (Demsetz, 1974; De Soto, 1989, 2000; Tanzi,
1982, 1999; Schneider, 1994, 1997; Gile, 1999; and Maloney 2004). Second, FDI
contributes to the official economic growth (neoclassical and endogenous growth
models; Romer, 1994; Choe, 2003; and Li & Liu, 2005); while official economic
growth reduces the size of unofficial economy (Dualist school of thought; La Porta and
Shleifer, 2008, 2014; and Williams, 2008). Third, FDI creates employments (Lall,
1995; Blomström, Fors & Lipsey, 1997; Eckel C, 2003; Fu & Balasubramanyam,
2005); and falling unemployment lowers shadow economy size (Boeri & Garibaldi,
2002; and Dell'Anno & Solomon, 2008).

        This chapter aims at providing empirical evidence from Asian countries on the
impact of FDI on the shadow economy, taking institutional quality into account; as
well as the impact of shadow economy on FDI; the bidirectional relation between FDI
and institutional quality; and the bidirectional nexus between institutional quality and
shadow economy by a simultaneous-equation model as follows (discussed in chapter 3)

FDIit = α0+ α1 INSTQUALITYit + α2 SHADOWit + αj Xi,t + εit (1)

INSTQUALITYit = β0 + β1FDIit + β2SHADOWit + βjYit + uit (2)

SHADOWit = γ0 + γ1FDIit + γ2INSTQUALITYit + γ3FDIit *INSTQUALITYit + γjZit

4.2. Data Analysis

4.2.1. Data descriptive statistics

    To examine the mutual relation amongst FDI, institutional quality and shadow
economy in the SEM model, the thesis uses a panel data of 19 countries in Asia during
1999-2015, consisting of Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia,
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Malaysia, Maldives, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal,
                                                98




     Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Vietnam. All variables, definitions,
     codes, authors who mentioned the effect in previous studies, their measurements,
     expected signs, data sources in the equations (1), (2), and (3) of the model SEM are
     legibly described in the Appendix A, B, C and E. The data are analyzed by using Stata
     software 14 (see the Appendix G for all Stata commands). Table 4.1 provides the
     summary statistics for the variables.

  4.2.2. Unit-root test

      Unit-root test proposed by Phillips & Perron (1988) to check the data stationarity
  with the null hypothesis that the variable is not stationary or gets unit-root. Results
  show that the null hypothesis is rejected for FDI, SHADOW, INSTQUALITY, DI,
  GDPG, LABOR, LABORQUALIT, FUEL, DEMOC, ECO_FREE, GOVT_BURDEN,
  TAX, GLOBAL, CORRUPT, U_RATE, RETIRE and URBAN. This implies that the
  above variables are stationary at levels and no transformation is needed for farther
  statistical analysis. Meanwhile, the Phillips-Perron (1988) tests cannot reject the null
  hypothesis for the remainder (including WAGE, OPEN, TEL, EDU and GNIPERC),
  indicating that these variables are not stationary at levels and thus they must be first-
                                             100




differenced to be stationary for further statistical analysis. The results for Phillips-
Perron unit-root test are provided in the table 4.2.

4.2.3. Correlation analysis

      The results of Pearson‘s correlation coefficient test show that most of
relationship between paired data are statistically significant (< or = 5%). To Evans
(1996), the correlation coefficients between paired data are acceptable if they are less
                                          102




than 0.8. All pairs of independents variables in the empirical model are satisfied for
estimations. The results of Pearson‘s correlation test are shown in the appendix F.

4.3. Empirical results and discussions

       The estimation results by methods of 3SLS (for the non-dynamic simultaneous
equations model) and Two Steps System GMM (for the dynamic simultaneous
equations model) are presented in the table 4.3.

   In the specification (1), the relationship amongst FDI, institutional quality and
shadow economy is estimated without control variables. This is the basic econometric
estimation. The robustness check is implemented in the specification (2) and (3) with
control variables. The control variables in the specification (2) include: domestic
investment, economic growth, labor force, labor quality, wage and natural resources in
the equation FDI; education, trading openness and income per capita in the equation
institutional quality; burden of government regulations, tax burden, globalization, GDP
growth, unemployment, retirement and urbanization in the equation shadow economy.
The specification (3) adds more control variables to the SEM, including trading
openness and infrastructure in the FDI equation; democracy and economic freedom in
the institutional quality equation; and corruption and economic freedom in the shadow
economy equation.

   Two-step System GMM is employed for the specification (1), (2) and (3).
Meanwhile, 3SLS is used for the specification 2 and 3 (the specification 1 does not
satisfy the order condition for 3SLS estimation). In 3SLS estimations, dummy
variables of countries and years are employed for fixed effects. Lagged level and
differenced variables of the dependent variables are used as instrumental variables for
SGMM estimations.

      T-statistics appear in parentheses; ***, ** and * indicate the significant levels at 1%,
      5% and 10% respectively.

             After 3SLS estimation, Breusch-Pagan tests and Hausman tests are used to
      check heteroskedasticity and endogeneity respectively. The results indicate the
      homoscedasticity in the specifications; and both consistency and efficiency obtained
      from 3SLS. Wald tests (chi-square) also reject the null hypothesis that all coefficients
      of the regressors are zero.

             After Two Steps System GMM, three types of tests will be used for the
      empirical model (Arellano and Bond, 1991). First, the Sargan tests with high P-values
      for all specifications fail to reject the null hypothesis of no over-identifying restriction,
      indicating that instruments are appropriate and specifications are well-determined.
      Second, the Arellano and Bond tests examine the hypothesis that the residuals from the
      estimations are first-order correlated (AR1) but not second-order correlated (AR2). The
      results from Arellano-Bond tests show that the null hypothesis of no serial correlation
      in the first differenced residuals (AR1) is rejected, and that the null hypothesis of no
      serial correlation in the second differenced residuals (AR2) is not rejected at 1% level
      of significance for all specifications. Third, Wald tests also reject the null hypothesis
      that all regressors are zero. All test results for 3SLS and Two Steps System GMM are
      reported in the table 4.3.

       The empirical results in the table 4.3 reveal main findings as follows:
       First, there is a positive bidirectional relationship between FDI and institutional
quality in all specifications with both estimation methods of 3SLS and Two Steps
System GMM at a significant level of 1%, confirming the first hypothesis that better
institutional quality in the host countries helps attract FDI inflows, and FDI inflows in
its turn improve institutional quality in the host countries. In particular, when
institutional quality increases by 1 unit, net FDI inflows measured as the percentage of
GDP increase by from 0.99% to 4.83%. When the ratio of FDI to GDP rises by 1%,
institutional quality rises by 0.038 to 0.096 units. This outcome is also supported by
previous studies such as those by Hyun (2006), Fukumi & Nishijima (2010) and Shah,
Ahmad, & Ahmed (2015). This finding adds to the literature an empirical evidence on
the positive bidirectional relationship between FDI and institutional quality in the
context of Asian countries.
       Second, there is a negative bidirectional nexus between institutional quality and
shadow economy in all specifications with both estimation methods of 3SLS and Two
Steps System GMM at a significant level of 1% (except 10 % level in specification 2 of
equation 3 with 3SLS), failing to reject the second hypothesis. Apparently, 1 unit rise
in institutional quality leads to a fall in shadow economy by around 2.25% - 9.43%.
This negative effect of institutional quality on shadow economy is supported by
Legalist school (Johnson et al., 1998; Friedman, Johnson, Kaufmann, & Zoido-Labton,
2000; Fugazza & Jacques, 2003; Dreher, Kotsogiannis & McCorriston, 2009; Dreher &
Schneider, 2010; Singh et al., 2012; Razmi et al., 2013; and Hassan & Schneider,
2016). However, the feedback effect of shadow economy on institutional quality is still
a research gap. And the result in my research, that shadow economy has a negative
impact on institutional quality, fills this gap. It is found that when a shadow economy
rises by 1%, institutional quality falls by 0.016 – 0.031 units. This finding can be
explained by combining previous separate studies under two main points: i) the rise of
                                             109




underground economy reduces the availability of public services because not many
people use public services when they operate underground (Loayza, 1997); ii) the
extension of shadow economy reduces the tax revenue (Kodila-Tedika & Mutascu,
2013) and the falling tax revenue decreases government income which leads to less
capacity to provide public goods with high quality (Broms, 2011). This result
contributes to the literature by two way: i) Legalism theory is modified in the view
that institutional quality is not only the cause but also the consequence of shadow
economy; and ii) studies on this relationship should take the endogeneity problems into
consideration.

       Third, the third and fourth hypotheses are affirmed when there are a negative
bidirectional relationship between FDI and shadow economy, and a negative impact of
the interaction between FDI and institutional quality on shadow economy in all
specifications with both estimation methods of 3SLS and Two Steps System GMM at
significant levels of 1% - 10% (except insignificance in specification 1of equation 1
with Two Steps System GMM). The negative impacts of FDI and of interaction
between FDI and institutional quality on shadow economy are the main contributions
of this thesis that have not been studied in the literature.

       Specifically, when the ratio of FDI to GDP goes up by 1%, the shadow
economy goes down by 0.43% - 1.25%. However, the total effect of FDI on shadow
economy is multiplied when the institutional quality is taken into account. Both γ1 and
γ3 are negative, indicating that FDI has a negative impact on shadow economy, and the
increase in institution quality intensifies this impact. It can be seen that the total effect
of FDI on shadow economy is derived from: i) the direct effect on shadow economy
(γ1); ii) the indirect effect on shadow economy (β1 * γ2). The coefficient β1 is the
marginal the effect of FDI on institutional quality and γ2 is the marginal impact of
institutional quality on shadow economy. By this way, when the ratio of FDI to GDP
                                           110




 rises by 1%, the shadow economy declines by 0.81% - 2%. The total impact of FDI on
 shadow economy is presented in the table 4.4.

        Thus, this result contribute to the literature that FDI can reduce the size of
 shadow economy through the channel of institutional quality improvement. Moreover,
 the negative feedback effect of shadow economy on institutional quality found in this
 study provides a new view-point for arguments in the literature because it is opposite to
 Nikopour et al. (2009) and Ali & Bohara (2017). These authors confirm that higher
 shadow economy increases FDI inflows since MNCs take advantages of tax evasion in
 host countries with higher size of shadow economy. However, I absolutely support my
 result (shadow economy reduces FDI) with a strong evidence that high shadow
 economy leads to low institutional quality (confirmed in hypothesis 2) and low
 institutional quality discourages FDI (confirmed in hypothesis 1).
                                            111




   Fourth, the negative effect of economic growth and positive effect of
unemployment on shadow economy also support the channels through which FDI can
reduce the shadow economy. The official economy and shadow economy are
substitutes, so the positive contribution of FDI to the official economic growth will
indirectly reduce the shadow economy. Besides, more jobs created from FDI make
unemployment decline, and declining unemployment also reduces shadow economy.

   Fifth, turning to each equation in the SEM, determinants of FDI, institutional
quality and shadow economy are verified in the context of Asian countries.

   i)     Factors such as domestic investment, GDP growth, labor force, labor quality
          and natural resources are found having positive impacts on attracting FDI
          inflows as expected at significant levels of 1%-10%. Wages have a negative
          impact on FDI inflows, but only significant at 1% in the specification (2)
          with 3SLS. FDI inflows are positively associated with trade openness and
          infrastructure, but not significant.
   ii)    Institutional quality is positively related to education, trade openness,
          income per capita and economic freedom at significant levels of 1%-10%, as
          confirmed in the literature. The negative effect of democracy on institutional
          quality in this thesis indicates that higher level of democracy leads to better
          institutional quality because lower index of democracy stands for higher
          freedom in scale of measurement.
   iii)   Factors that have positive effects on shadow economy include the burden of
          government regulations, tax burden, economic freedom, corruption,
          unemployment, and retirement at significances of 1%-10% as asserted in
          previous studies. However, the official economy and urbanization are
          negatively associated with the shadow economy in Asian countries. To dual
          approach, the economic growth negatively affects shadow economy because
                                           112




          dualists view the shadow economy as a residual or a by-product of the
          official economy and economic growth is the cure for the shadow economy
          (La Porta and Shleifer, 2008, 2014; Williams, 2008). To Elgin & Oyvat
          (2013), there is an inverted-U relationship between the level of urbanization
          and the share of shadow economy. To their interpretation, the share of the
          shadow economy rises in the early phase of urbanization due to several pull
          and push factors; but it tends to fall in the latter phase when the impact of
          these pull and push factors are reduced as a natural result of rural dwellers
          getting wealthier.

   In conclusion, the empirical results confirm the first four hypotheses in this thesis -
i.e. FDI and institutional quality are positively related; institutional quality and shadow
economy are negatively linked; there is a negative bidirectional nexus between FDI
and shadow economy; and the interaction of institutional quality and FDI is negatively
associated with shadow economy in Asia.

5.1. Introduction

    For recent decades, shadow economies and income inequality have attracted a
great deal of increasing attention from scholars and policymakers because they affect
economic growth, institutional quality and public policies (Dell‘Anno, 2016).
Especially in the context of Asia, both of them have been rising amid rapid growth.

    The considerable increase of shadow economies in Asian countries suggests that
national accounts data is on average significantly underestimated (Bajada and
Schneider, 2005). The estimated average size of shadow economy in Asian countries is
30.94 % of official GDP in the period of 1990-2015, experiencing an increase of
10.24% (Medina & Schneider, 2018). The size of shadow economy in Asian countries
is empirically attributed to the money demand, tax burden, private consumption,
interest rate and GNI per capita (Vo, 2015). The presence of shadow economy distorts
the allocation of resources, alters income distribution and reduces governments‘ tax
                                          114




revenue (Alm & Embaye, 2013). If this sector is ignored, it is biased to assess the
outcomes of various economic policies.

    Meanwhile, recent rapid economic growth in Asia has reduced poverty but
widened income gap in many countries. Four-fifths of Asia‘s populations live in
countries with rising unequality over the past 20 years (Kanbur, Rhee, & Zhuang,
2014). In specific, the Gini coefficient has increased in 12 Asian economies, including
China, India, and Indonesia – three countries account for 82% of the population in the
region. The Gini coefficient increased from 32.43 in 1990 to 42.16 in 2012 in China,
from 30.82 in 1993 to 35.15 in 2011 in India, and from 29.19 in 1990 to 35.57 in 2010
in Indonesia (World Bank, 2017b). The rising inequality causes many consequences
such as: i) hampering the pace at which growth enables poverty reduction (Ravallion,
2004); ii) undermining the growth process and sustainability through many channels of
economic, social, and political mechanisms (Ostry, Berg, & Tsangarides, 2014); iii)
lowering institutional quality- one of key factors for development (Chong & Gradstein,
2007b; Zhuang et al., 2010). The figure 5 displays the shadow economy and income
inequality in Asian countries in the period 1990-2015.

2015) (Source: Medina & Schneider, 2018; World Bank, 2017a)

                     The increase of both shadow economies and income inequality in Asia as
mentioned above suggests an idea that they have a positive relationship. This
hypothesis is also supported by Rosser et al. (2000, 2003) in their studies for transition
economies. As a result, many governments try to minimize the size of shadow
economy with enforcement policies. Nevertheless, the shadow economy has its own
advantages. For example, two-thirds of the income earned in the shadow economy is
immediately spent in the official economy (Schneider and Dominik, 2000). Smith
(2002) also points out that shadow economy can create jobs for individuals and
increase their income. Besides, Valentini (2009) argues that the income evasion
attached to non-observed economy tends to reduce inequality measured by regular
wages in the case of Italian private sector employees.
                                           116




    Deriving from the above practical background and arguments, this research is
done. In this study, I hope to contribute to the literature by using a cross-country panel
data regression to examine the impact of shadow economy on income inequality. I
hypothesize the negative effect of shadow on income inequality by combining three
schools of thought on shadow economy, including Dualism, Legalism and
Voluntarism, with two theoretical points. First, Dualists with the residue theory depict
the shadow economy as a set of survival activities performed in a marginal society,
generating income for the poor (Hart, 1973; Sethuraman, 1976; and Tokman, 1978).
Thus the shadow economy is expected to increase the income share of the poor.
Second, Legalists and Voluntarists with the alternative theory of shadow economy
contend that the rising shadow economy creates unfair competition for businesses and
employees between the formal and informal sectors (Chen, 2012). Moreover, to dual
approach, shadow economy attracts most of the poor and small businesses, but not the
rich and big businesses. Therefore, the unfair competition from shadow economy may
reduce the income share of the rich. As a result, the shadow economy may lessen the
income inequality in Asia.
    In order to estimate the effect of shadow economy on income inequality in 19
Asian countries, I use the following linear model (as proposed in chapter 3)
       INEQUALITYit = λ1 SHADOWit + δjVi,t + µi + εit (4)


5.2. Data descriptive statistics

   A panel data of 19 Asian countries over the period 1990-2015 for all variables in
the equation (4) is collected from various sources. We employ the data for shadow
economy from the estimations by Medina & Schneider (2018); Education index from
Human Development Report, UNDP; Control of corruption from Worldwide
Governance Indicators (World Bank, 2017b); Institutional quality from Global
                                           117




Competitiveness Index, World Economic Forum; Economic freedom index from the
Economic Freedom Report 2016, Fraser Institute. The remainders, consisting of Gini
coefficient, the income share held by lowest quintile, the income share held by highest
quintile, employment in services, inflation, trade openness, and land per capita are
collected from World Development Indicators (World Bank, 2017a). All variables,
definitions, codes, authors who mentioned the effect in previous studies, their
measurements, expected signs, data sources in the model 2 (equation 4) are described
in the Appendix D and E. The data are analyzed by using Stata software 14 (see the
Appendix H for all Stata commands). Table 5.1 provides the definition, measurement
and summary statistics for all variables in the equation (4).

5.3. Empirical results and discussions
    After estimating 3 specifications and performing tests (Breusch-Pagan, Cook-
Weisberg, Modified Wald, Wooldridge), I obtain the results for 3 ways of estimations
(POLS, FE, RE). In general, shadow economy significantly has negative effects on the
Gini coefficient and the income share held by highest quintile, and a positive effect on
the income share held by lowest quintile in three different estimating methods of
POLS, FE and RE. However, I apply the F-tests and the Hausman tests to choose the
most appropriate estimation model for each proxy of income inequality. Particularly, I
first use the F-tests to choose between POLS and FE under the null hypothesis of no
country-specific effects in intercepts. Second, Hausman tests are run to choose between
FE and RE with the null hypothesis that difference in coefficients is not systematic - or
country-specific effects are uncorrelated with independent variables - (Wooldridge,
2010). As a result, FE method is employed for the specification 1 and 2 while RE
method is appropriate for the specification 3. The ultimate estimation results are
provided in the table 5.2.

       Then, the 2-Step System GMM is also employed to check the robustness of the
estimation and to control endogeneity caused by the feedback effect of income
inequality on shadow economy. The SGMM can perform with linear dynamic panel-
data estimation to solve the problems of endogeneity, heteroskedasticity and
autocorrelation (Blundell and Bond, 1998). Two types of tests are used for the
empirical model (Arellano and Bond, 1991). First, the Sargan test checks the validity
of instruments and specifications. Second, the Arellano and Bond test examines the
hypothesis that the residuals from the estimations are first-order correlated (AR1) but
not second-order correlated (AR2). Estimation results for the impact of shadow
economy on income inequality by 2 Steps SGMM are presented in the table 5.3. The
consistence is confirmed with similar results for different estimation methods.

T-statistics appear in parentheses; ***, ** and * indicate the significant levels at 1%,
5% and 10% respectively.

      The results (from RE, FE and SGMM estimations) indicate that the shadow
economy negatively affects income inequality (proxied by the Gini coefficient) and the
income share held by highest quintile at a significant level of 1 percent; while its
impact on the income share held by lowest quintile is positive at 10 percent
significance, failing to reject the fifth hypothesis. In particular, when the size of
shadow economy as percentage share of official GDP rises by 1%, the income
inequality falls by 0.116 - 0.146 units, the income share held by highest quintile falls
by 0.062 - 0.079%, and the income share held by lowest quintile rises by 0.020 -
0.034% on average. In other words, the shadow economy can reduce income inequality
because it lessens the income share held by highest quintile and raises the income share
                                         123




held by lowest quintile. The findings seem to be contrary to initial research on this
issue by Rosser et al. (2000) who conclude with caution that there is a positive
relationship between income inequality and shadow economy. However, my results
can be explained by combining the three schools of thought on shadow economy. To
Dualists, the shadow economy mainly attracts the poor and small businesses,
generating income for them (Hart, 1973). Therefore, the shadow economy increases the
income share of the poor. Meanwhile, Legalists and Voluntarists contend that the rising
shadow economy creates unfair competition for businesses and employees between the
formal and informal sectors (Chen, 2012). Moreover, to dual approach, shadow
economy attracts most of the poor and small businesses, but not the rich and big
businesses. Therefore, the unfair competition from shadow economy may reduce the
income share of the rich.
     Besides, other determinants significantly found to have negative impacts on
income inequality as expected in our research include the employment in services,
trading openness, institutional quality, and land per person. Education also affects
income inequality negatively but it is insignificant. However, economic freedom is
found to increase the income inequality, indicating a trade-off of economic freedom
and equality demonstrated by Carter (2007): higher levels of economic freedom are
significantly associated with lower equality by reducing income redistribution toward
the poor. Inflation and corruption have positive effects on income inequality but they
are not statistically significant.
     A comparison on the effect of income inequality factors on the income share held
by poorest 20% and the income share held by richest 20% also provides helpful results.
The income share held by poorest quintile is significantly and positively associated
with employment in services, trade openness and institutional quality. However,
economic freedom reduces the income share held by poorest quintile while it raises that
                                           124




held by richest quintile. Some factors attributed to reduction of the income share held
by richest quintile are trade openness, and land per person.

    In conclusion, the empirical evidence from 19 Asian countries shows that shadow
economy can help reduce income inequality by significantly increasing the income
share held by lowest quintile and decreasing the income share held by highest quintile.

6.1. Conclusions

       This thesis aims at solving two main research objectives: (1) examine the causal
relationship among FDI, institutional quality and shadow economy in Asian countries;
(2) investigate the impact of shadow economy on income inequality and the channel of
the impact in Asia. All of five research questions are satisfactorily answered. The
empirical results in chapter 4 and chapter 5 demonstrate some concluding remarks as
follows.

       First, the author combines the three theories of international trade, institutions
and shadow economy with an integrative approach to investigate the three-way
linkages between FDI, institutional quality and shadow economy in the context of
Asian countries, formulating the mechanism these variables interact to foster economic
growth. This is the first study that explores the three-way linkages amongst these
variables. In particular, the thesis fills the empirical gap on the positive bidirectional
relationship between FDI inflows and institutional quality in the context of Asian
countries by combining the Eclectic Paradigm (Dunning, 1980) and the
                                          126




Institutionalization Theory (North, 1990), opposing the Pollution Haven Hypothesis by
He (2006) who suggests the negative impact of institutional quality on FDI. In
addition, the negative bidirectional nexus between institutional quality and shadow
economy found from the thesis modifies the Legalism theory of shadow economy:
institutional quality is not only the cause (main arguments of Legalists) but also the
consequence of shadow economy (findings from the thesis); and therefore studies on
this relationship should take the endogeneity problems into consideration. Furthermore,
the negative bidirectional relationship between FDI and shadow economy fills the
theoretical and empirical gaps in Asia by taking institutional quality into account: FDI
inflows reduce shadow economy through the channel of institutional quality
improvements resulted from FDI inflows; higher shadow is associated with lower
institutional quality which discourages FDI inflows; and the interaction of FDI and
institutional quality also has a negative impact on shadow economy, indicating that
FDI inflows negatively affect the shadow economy and institutional quality
improvements intensify this effect.

      Second, the research finds out that shadow economies negatively affect income
inequality by increasing the income share held by lowest quintile and decreasing the
income share held by highest quintile. This result is opposite to previous studies
(Rosser et al., 2000, 2003), adding more arguments to the literature which supports the
view on advantages of shadow economy especially to the poor. The findings can be
explained by combining the three schools of thought on shadow economy: Dualism,
Legalism and Volutarism with two theoretical points: First, Dualists with the residue
theory depict the shadow economy as a set of survival activities performed in a
marginal society, generating income for the poor (Hart, 1973; Sethuraman, 1976; and
Tokman, 1978). Thus the shadow economy is expected to increase the income share of
the poor. Second, Legalists and Voluntarists with the alternative theory of shadow
                                          127




economy contend that the rising shadow economy creates unfair competition for
businesses and employees between the formal and informal sectors (Chen, 2012).
Nevertheless, this unfair competition between the two sectors eventually turns out to be
a channel to help reduce income inequality because to dual approach, shadow economy
attracts most of the poor and small businesses, but not the rich and big businesses.
Therefore, the unfair competition from shadow economy may reduce the income share
of the rich since the poor get more benefit from working underground. As a result, the
shadow economy may lessen the income inequality.

      Third, other determinants of FDI, institutional quality, shadow economy and
income inequality are also identified in the context of developing Asia. Drivers of FDI
consist of domestic investment, GDP growth, labor force, labor quality, lower wages,
trade openness, infrastructure and natural resources. Determinants of institutional
quality comprise education, trade openness, income per capita, economic freedom and
democracy. Factors influencing the size of shadow economies include the burden of
government regulations, tax burden, economic freedom, corruption, unemployment,
retirement, the official economy and urbanization. Employment in services, trading
openness, institutional quality, land per person, education and economic freedom are
determinants of income inequality.

      Fourth, results from chapters 4 and 5 support the appropriateness in formulating
models and in selecting econometric methodologies. Especially, the panel
simultaneous-equation modelling approach with both non-dynamic and dynamic forms
is fitting to examine the three-way linkages amongst foreign direct investment,
institutional quality and shadow economy because these variables are simultaneously
determined. The empirical insights suggest helpful policy implications to deal with
these dynamics simultaneously.

6.2. Policy implications

       The above concluding outcomes suggest some policy implications as follows.

       First, the positive bidirectional nexus between FDI and institutional quality
shows that institutional quality plays an important role in attracting FDI, and FDI is
also a channel to improve institutional quality. The positive causality implies that FDI
and institutional quality are complementary for boosting economic growth and
development in Asian countries. Thus, governments should implement simultaneous
policies for attracting FDI and improving institutional quality to take advantage of this
positive two-way causal relationship.

       Second, the negative bidirectional relationship between institutional quality and
shadow economy suggests that the efficient institutional innovation in Asia is a
solution not only to increase the official economic growth as it is thought to be, but
also to reduce shadow economies, and lower shadow economies will enhance the
process of institutional improvement. Policies for institutional reform and reduction of
informal activities should be simultaneously carried out to intensify the effectiveness of
the policy combination.

       Third, the negative bidirectional causality between FDI and shadow economy as
well as the negative impact of FDI – institutional quality interaction on shadow
economy evince that FDI can help reduce shadow economies though the channel of
institutional improvement and lower shadow economies – which increase institutional
quality – in its turn encourage FDI inflows. Therefore, policies to attract FDI, to
improve institutional quality and to reduce the size of the shadow economy should be
implemented at the same time to utilize the three-way linkages.
                                            129




       Fourth, simultaneous policies to attract FDI, to improve institutional quality and
to reduce shadow economies should focus on promoting trade liberalization and
democratization, lessening the burden of government regulations, enhancing the quality
of education, human resources, and effective use of natural resources, as well as
promoting growth and increasing per capita income.

       Fifth, the negative impact of shadow economy on income inequality supports
the advantage of shadow economy to the poor. That is why policies to deal with the
shadow economy should take the poor into close consideration with other solutions for
poverty eradication and inequality reduction in developing countries. Besides, policies
to reduce income inequality should focus on boosting economic freedom with care,
enhancing trade exchanges, improving institutional quality, creating more jobs in
services, and efficiently allocating natural resources.

6.3. Limitations and further research implications

       The measurement of shadow economy seems to be sensitive to the estimation
methods. Although the data set from Medina & Schneider (2018), released by IMF in
which the most popular MIMIC approach is used for shadow economy estimation, is
the newest one that I use in this thesis, it is more robust if various scenarios of how
shadow economy estimated should be considered.

       Besides, the unavailability of data is also the weakness of the thesis when all
Asian countries cannot be considered. Therefore, similar research on the relationships
among FDI, institutional quality, shadow economy and income inequality should be
investigated in greater details for both developed and developing countries all over the
world in future research to have more comprehensive conclusions.
