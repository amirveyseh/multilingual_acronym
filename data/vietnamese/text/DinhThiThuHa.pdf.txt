                                    CHAPTER 1

                                INTRODUCTION

1.1 Research motivation:

Seasoned equity offerings (SEOs) draw enormous attention from researchers
around the world. This method is an effective and popular way to expand
company financial resources to maintain and develop its activities, to reconstruct
capital and stakeholder structure of company. In order to finance companies’
activities, they can choose either internal sources or external sources of funding.
While the former mainly refer to profit or retained earnings, the latter mention the
concept of debt financing as well as equity financing. To estimate company’s
financing decisions Modigliani and Miller (1958, 1963) suggest that capital
structure is not consistent with firm value. Nevertheless, this observation is based
on the important assumption that the market is perfect. The idea of perfect capital
market consists of the following characteristics: (i) companies are classified based
on their risk; additionally, companies having the same risk generate similar
returns; (ii) perfect capital market which implies that there is no transaction cost,
also no tax or bankruptcy cost; (iii) the interest rate for lending and borrowing
activities are similar for private and investors as well as corporation. However, in
the real market, tax is deducted from interest expenditure. Nevertheless, debt
financing pressure may discourage firms to entirely use debt financing instead of
equity financing (Huang, 2012). Besides the trade-off theory which mainly
discuss tax shield as well as financial distress, there are also other factors affect
the financing decision of company including information asymmetry costs,
agency conflict costs and the availability of promising growth opportunities

Besides, a trend of increasing international equity issuance has also been
reported, especially after the financial crisis in 2010. To compensate for the losses
                                         2




and larger writedowns suffering from the crisis as well as to raise capital in the
prediction of more strict regulations will occur, global financial institutions have
to raise equity issuance substantially. A report of Bloomberg in July 2010 shown
that financial institutions, mainly from Europe and the United States, since mid-
2007 had raised US$1.5 trillion equity issue to offset their crisis losses (Witmer,
2010).
The paucity of literature and case study in emerging market where results are
inclusive also urge a solution. There have been many research to find out
company and market behavior such as determinants of companies that lead them
to conduct SEOs, impact of SEOs on company stock prices when information
about SEOs are publicized. The number of research on this topic has been
increasing with many aspects have been discovered and applied in practice.
However, the majority of existing SEOs research are examined at developed
market (Eckbo et. al., 2007) while only few research on cases of emerging market
are conducted. The paucity of literature and case study in emerging market has
drawn attentions from researchers to this market. Therefore, examining emerging
economy case attracts the interest to fill the research gap and emphasize the own
nature of this market. In additional, examining whether the results of developed
markets can be carried over to emerging market also becomes appealing. In
addition to examining determinants of company’s SEOs decision, researchers also
show that stock prices on the market will be affected when information about the
issuance is publicized. In contrast to negative reactions in developed markets, the
results of emerging markets are inclusive. While there is a trend of positive
reaction in the research of Kim and Lee (1990) for Korea; Salamudin et. al.
(1999) for Malaysia; Tan et. al. (2002) for Singapore; Marisetty et. al.
(2008) for Indian, the findings of Cahit (2006) for Turkey; Chen et. al. (2007)
and Shahid (2010) for China; and Lerskullawat (2011) for Thailand, on the other
                                         3




hand show negative reaction.

The development and new trend in financing resources of Vietnamese Stock
market also become a driving force. Since its first establishment with only two
listed companies in 2000, Vietnamese stock market has witnessed remarkable
development, the number of listed companies has strongly increased in both listed
value and market capitalization (Figure 1.1). Besides, Vietnamese stock market
gradually becomes more attractive to foreign investors. International integration
helps raise the position, foster Vietnamese stock market to a higher level among
international financial market (e.g. in 2013, the HOSE became official member of
the World Federation of Exchanges), enhance the value of listed companies,
attract more foreign investment, and achieve more opportunities so that it can
access to international standards, exchange and absorb the experience of
developed markets. With that impressive development, Vietnamese stock market,
however, is still a very young market with the history of only over 15 years since
its establishment. Vietnamese companies are still in favor of traditional finance
such as loans borrow from banks. However, high lending interest rate (table 1.1)
accompanied by the financial crisis in 2010 had strongly affect the banking
system, firms were not confident in the possibility of providing loans from banks,
and in return, bank themselves had no belief in firm’s ability to pay the loan since
both sides were impacted due to the crisis. Consequently, when bank financing
can not play its traditional roles, companies turn their attentions to equity
financing.

In addition, SEOs gradually become more appealing to Vietnamese companies.
From 2007 to 2013, there were 482 cases that companies use SEOs to pay
bonuses or dividends, or to increase their financial resources by issuing equity
rights offerings. This fact has shown that SEOs is a popular method for
companies to manage their financial and investment activities, gradually become
more widespread and of interest in Vietnam. Furthermore, SEOs on Vietnamese
stock market also draw attention from researchers e.g. Nguyen Quang Diep
(2011) examines capability of Vietnamese investors in evaluating long-run
operating performance of the issuers. Vo Xuan Vinh and Doan Minh Thai (2015)
investigate market reaction to company stock price and trading volume when
information about cash dividend is publicized. Vo Xuan Vinh and Phan Thi Anh
Thu (2015) examine market reaction to information about companies’ stock split.
Vo Xuan Vinh and Dang Buu Kiem (2015) investigate trading of foreign
investors when information about cash dividend is announced. Recently, Vo
Xuan Vinh and Dang Buu Kiem (2016) examine the stock market reaction
measured by abnormal trading volume around ex-dividend day using data set of
listed firms on HOSE. However, there is lack of study investigating thoroughly
behavior of listed companies in regarding of why Vietnamese companies conduct
SEOs and market reaction around event day when information about SEOs by
dividend or rights are publicized. Therefore, limited number of SEOs literature in
the context of Vietnam should be increased to fill this empirical gap.

The important function of SEOs in the Vietnamese capital market and in case of
SEOs companies, accompanied by the role of enhancing knowledge of investors
about behavior of SEOs companies and behavior of the market have led us to this
comprehensive research. Base on the findings, we then point out relevant
suggestions for related stakeholders such as SEOs companies and investors.
                                         6




             In case of investors: should investors join or leave companies that
             intend to issue SEOs. Are there any signs to recognize the issuance
             in order to prepare necessary financial resources in case investors
             want to join the issuance? What are relevant investment strategies
             toward equity of company conducting SEOs in order to earn
             money?

             In case of SEOs companies: what methods could be applied to
             increase the effectiveness of the issuance in terms of maximizing
             proceeds collected from the issuance and increasing company value
             by conducting SEOs.



1.2 Research objectives

Vietnam is in the CIVETS group include Colombia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt,
Turkey, and South Africa which can be represented for new stardom candidates
among emerging markets. Although these six CIVETS countries still suffer from
some disparities during their development, they do have common element for
emerging market such as young populations, stable politics, domestic economic
structure diversification, less commodity exports reliance, relatively developed
financial markets, outperforming returns potential (Korkmaz et. al., 2012).

The main objectives of this thesis are to investigate thoroughly SEOs in the
context of emerging market with Vietnamese stock market case. This objective
serves to fill the gap of literature lacking in this region. Besides, it is among the
first study in Vietnam to focus on many aspects of SEOs in terms of
determinants of company’s SEOs motivation, market reaction and determinants
of market reaction to company’s SEOs.
                                        7




We examine SEOs in Vietnam on two aspects:

             Company’s SEOs motivation by examining why do Vietnamese
             companies conduct SEOs.

             Market reaction to company’s SEOs by examining how does
             market react to company’s SEOs, which express through the
             fluctuations of stock prices. Subsequently, we develop the
             estimation model to measure to what extend the theories mentioned
             in previous SEO studies can be applied to explain market reaction
             to companies SEOs in case of Vietnam stock market.

Furthermore, we then compare our findings with existing literatures.



1.3   Research questions

Objective 1: Examining company’s SEOs motivation

             Why do Vietnamese companies conduct SEOs?

Objective 2: Examining market reaction to company’s SEOs

             How does market react to company’s SEOs?

             Does    classifying   companies     into   three   criteria:   Market
             capitalization, Industry and Issuance method make any differences
             in terms of market reaction?

             To what extend the theories mentioned in previous SEO studies can
             be applied to explain market reaction to companies SEOs in case of
             Vietnam stock market?

1.4 Research scope

This research covers only companies listed on the HOSE during 2007 – 2013.
Stock prices are collected from HOSE website. The data is collected from
financial statements of HOSE listed companies which are extracted from the
database of Orbis.

Research sample comprises companies conducting their SEOs as right
distributions; or rights accompanied with dividends; or rights accompanied with
bonuses; and companies issued their SEOs as bonus or dividend payments.

The event days include announcement day and ex-right day which are widely
publicized on the media.

SEOs companies are classified according to three criteria (market capitalization,
issuance method and industry).


1.5 Research methods:

To examine the company’s SEOs motivation, we apply logit/probit model to find
the determinants of company motivation to issue SEOs. Based on the interpreted
results, we will suggest relevant recommendation for investors and SEOs
companies.

To examine the market reaction to company’s SEOs, we first apply the Event
study method developed by Campbell, Lo and MacKinlay (1997) to study the
market reaction around event day, then using random effects and fixed effects
model on panel data to investigate determinants of market reaction around event
day. Based on Hausman test, we select the appropriate model and interpret
results in according to relevant financial theories then point out relevant
suggestions for stakeholders.

1.6 Research contributions:

Contribution to SEOs literature:

Our research covers different aspects from previous research regarding SEOs
area. Firstly, we investigate SEOs using data from Vietnamese market which has
not been examined yet. We refer to SEOs literature in both developed and other
emerging markets to form the research hypotheses then examine whether the
results of those markets can be carried over to Vietnam.

Conducting research on SEOs is mainly based on Event study; its objective is to
measure the financial assets value fluctuation, which is resulted from particular
event. The number of research applying this method is approximate 565 topics
from 1974 to 2000 in top five journals of business and finance (Khotari and
Warner, 2006), however the number of studies on SEOs in developing countries
is relatively limited. In addition to the out-of-sample tests, this research also fills
the gap and enriches the literature on cases of emerging market where the results
are inclusive and very limited, from then to draw an overall picture in
comparison to developed markets, which have been wildly discovered; therefore
the research findings enrich existing literature related to SEOs in Vietnamese
market, especially to discover how much Vietnamese stock market can catch up
with mature market. This research also examines Vietnamese stock market
characteristics, Vietnamese investors and SEOs companies on many aspects:
SEOs motivations and market reaction.

Contribution to empirical study:

Raising capital through conducting SEOs brings certain benefits to issuing
companies in comparison to debt borrowing or cash dividends. However, there
are very few research about this topic be conducted at Vietnamese stock
exchange, Vietnamese listed companies, therefore lack of necessary references.
                                       11




With this research, we fill the gap about SEOs research and contribute an
empirical study since it enrich existing literature of SEOs in Vietnam. Investors,
SEOs companies can use this research as a reference material in their trading,
investment and management activities toward information management, making
trading decisions. Investors could consider trading stocks of SEOs companies to
earn profits, reserve money in advance to “catch the issuance”, or to have
relevant actions toward these kind of SEOs.

SEOs is also considered a way to test the efficiency level of the market.
Furthermore, the level of efficiency of market can be reflected through the
transparency of information, which is one of the most crucial elements that
market legislators should ensure to the investors, especially the minor ones.
Market legislators can consider using this research as a way to test the level of
information transparency in the market to take relevant actions toward the
current market situation.

Applying a well-known Event study method to investigate how does market
react to different issuing method such as to increase company capital by equity
rights or to pay bonuses/dividends, we compare stock price reaction to those two
methods to provide more evidence in the field of SEOs in Vietnam, which can be
used as reference or studying material for students.



1.7 Structure of the study:

The remaining of the research is organized as follows: Chapter 2 presents the
literature concerned SEOs in most relevant study. We review thoroughly how
SEOs research have been examined in both developed as well as emerging
market. For an easily approach we then build a conceptual framework to
summarize financial theories that have been previously applied. At the end of
                                       12




this chapter, based on the existing SEOs literature in both developed and other
emerging markets we develop hypotheses for our study. We also include in this
chapter three appendices to summarize tables of our literature surveys.

In Chapter 3: Data and Methodology, we present the way our data is collected,
along with the criteria to classify them. Besides, we describe methodology is
applied in our study with proxies for the relevant theories, estimation regression
models, along with the detail description of Event study method, which help in
our empirical estimation in chapter 4 and chapter 5.

Chapter 4: Determinants of company’s SEOs motivation is the first empirical
result chapter regarding to companies motivations that lead them to conduct
SEOs. We examine the determinants in four areas: trade-off, growth
opportunities, market timing and agency problem theory, those theories have
strong impact on company’s SEOs decisions. In this chapter, the logit/probit
model is applied to identify determinants of company’s SEOs motivation. We
then compare our results to existing previous study to draw a comprehensive
picture on Vietnamese case.

Chapter 5 examines market reaction to SEOs in two categories: (1) how the
stock prices fluctuate around announcement day and the ex-right day; (2) the
determinants of stock price reactions. We apply the standard Event study method
to measure the stock price reaction while regression models on panel data (Fixed
effect and Random effect models) are chosen to examine determinants of market
reaction to company’s SEOs. In this chapter, we focus on the differences of
stock price reactions after classifying the data into three criteria: market
capitalization, industry and issuance method, we especially focus on the type of
issuance method on whether companies issue SEOs to raise capital by equity
                                       13




rights or to pay dividends/bonuses due to our expectation that different purposes
of issuance will lead to remarkable differences in the way the market react.

In chapter Conclusion and Suggestion, we summarize our findings and point out
relevant suggestions for related stakeholders.



1.8 A summary of thesis findings:

We present main results in two aspects: SEO motivations and market reaction to
company’s SEOs.

In conclusion, regarding the motivations of company’s SEOs, it is found that two
over four seminal theories are supported: (i) in term of trade-off theory, we find
that companies with lower leverage ratio in comparison to average of industry’s
leverage ratio are more likely to use SEOs to adjust their capital structure. This
result is irrelevant to the trade-off theory since we expect companies with higher
leverage ratio in comparison to average of industry’s leverage ratio have more
possibility to use SEOs to reduce leverage; however in case of Vietnamese
companies, this result might be explained that companies with lower ratio of
leverage relative to industry’s average leverage will also have tendency to issue
SEOs in order to fill the gap in capital shortage of company. (2) Regarding the
growth opportunities theory, our results suggest that companies tend to issue
SEOs when they have more growth opportunities, which is consistent with the
growth opportunity theory. (3) Regarding the market timing theory, we find that
companies experience higher ratio of market value/book value tend to conduct
SEOs more. We believe this supports the market timing theory that predicts
companies will choose the time when market overvalues their stocks to issue
seasoned equity. (4) Regarding agency problem theory, we find no evidence to
support decision that SEOs is motivated as a tool to conduct advantage over
                                        14




minority shareholders by controlling shareholders, which is inconsistent with the
agency problem theory. Besides the main theories, we also find that smaller
companies, companies with higher ratio of total debts/total assets, companies
with higher profitability are more likely to conduct SEOs.

Examine on market behavior, our results show that Ho Chi Minh stock market is
not efficient in term of semi-strong form. Before the announcement day, there is
a trend of stock purchasing, which is a sign of information leakage

Around announcement day, price increase significantly in both period before and
after that day. On contrary, in case of ex-right day, after this day, the increasing
trend will not prolong.

Before event day, market tends to favor companies conduct SEOs by equity
bonuses or dividends than by equity rights. However, investors will soon adjust
their behavior by selling those stocks which already generated high profit.

In examining the determinants of market reaction to company’s SEOs around
announcement day, our results show that (1) There are no evidences to support
the influences of growth opportunities on market reaction around announcement
day. However, in case of Vietnamese stock market, this result can be explained
that investor might not see information about growth opportunities advantageous
information when consider buying SEOs, or they are not fully aware of the
availability of company growth opportunities. (2) Regarding to market timing
theory, we find that the condition of the market before announcement day
influences the market reaction. Investors will base on the condition of the market
from 2 to 3 months before announcement day to make their decisions on whether
to get involved in company SEOs. This result supports market timing theory
influence on determinants of market reaction to company’s SEOs. Besides, our
                                       15




result shows that equity rights generated less returns than the method of equity
bonuses or dividends.

Regarding the determinants of market reaction to company’s SEOs, (1) TobinQ
which is proxy for growth opportunities is significant with positive signs,
suggesting that the information about existence of company growth opportunities
influence the reaction of the market. We conclude that the growth opportunities
theory impact on market reaction around ex-right day. (2) The market timing
theory, on the other hand show no significant result, implying that market
condition before ex-right day does not influence the reaction of the market.
Besides, we find positive relation between issue size and market reaction. This
might be explained that in case of Vietnamese stock exchange, the larger the
issuance, the higher that market liquidity, which leads to positive reaction of the
market. Firm size shows negative relation to market reaction around ex-right
day. We think that, in case of Vietnamese stock market, investors might believe
that the larger the company is, the more complicated it is, therefore the capital
generated from the issuance may not be used effectively.

                                 CHAPTER 2
     LITERATURE REVIEW AND HYPOTHESES DEVELOPMENT

2.1 Introduction

SEOs play significant role on company capital structure as well as stakeholder
structure. This chapter present different studies about SEOs in both developed as
well as emerging markets. Theoretical investigations cover main theories
regarding SEOs including Trade-off; Agency problem; Growth opportunities;
and Market timing. The evidences of these studies are mostly similar in both
developed and emerging economies. The organization of this section is as
followed:

The main purpose of section 2.2 is to review financial theories regarding SEOs,
while in section 2.3 the findings of previous research in terms of determinants of
company’s SEOs motivation, market reaction as well as determinants of market
reaction to company’s SEOs that have been used in previous SEOs research will
be reviewed; from then the conceptual framework will be built up to form an
overall picture. In section 2.4, we build the research hypotheses and variables
measurements while Section 2.5 is the conclusion of this chapter.



2.2 Theoretical literature on SEOs
2.2.1 Trade-off theory

Study of financial structure has been dominated the research area of corporate
finance. Since Modigliani and Miller (1958) first introduce their research on
financial structure in the context of capital costs, corporate finance and
investment theory, it has drawn enormous attention from researchers to the
discussion about the applicability of financial structure theory into reality. The
                                        17




research of Modigliani and Miller has set the very first step of financial theory
development in terms of compromising tax system and bankruptcy costs
considering then the existence of an optimal ratio of debt suggesting (Ghazouani,
2013)

Trade-off theory is one of the financial theories that have significant impact on
company capital structure in the context of corporate and personal taxes effects,
bankruptcy costs, etc. According to trade-off theory, company will try to aim at a
target debt level to form an optimal capital structure then gradually move
towards it. This theory suggests that managers need to make right decision on
building financial structure to keep balance as well as optimize the equity and
liability in the company. The optimal debt-equity structure in a company can be
determined by trading off the costs and benefits of financing through debt and
equity. According the trade-off theory, company conducts SEOs to optimize
capital structure to balance the benefit and expense that might be generated from
debt borrowing (Modigliani and Miller, 1958, 1963; Myers, 1977). This will lead
to the existence of a target leverage that maximizes the value of the firm,
requiring that any deviation from that target leverage should be adjusted.

Trade-off theory has been testified by some empirical research as one of the
theories affect company’s SEOs decisions (Marsh, 1982; Hovakimian et. al.,
2001; Bo et. al., 2011). Hovakimian et. al., (2001) show that when companies
adjust their capital structure, they tend to move toward a target debt ratio that is
consistent with theories based on tradeoffs between the costs and benefits of debt.
On the other hand, Bo et. al. (2011) investigate the relevance of traditional
theories Chinese SEOs motivation. With the case of 1081 Chinese SEOs during
1994–2008, the authors find that the trade-off theory is consistent to Chinese
listed companies who strongly depend on loan borrowings from the banking
                                         18




sector because of weak debt market. Borrowing companies are under strictly bank
monitoring, which means their main concern is borrowing costs. Furthermore, it
is found that Chinese companies pay attention to tax revenue from debt financing.
As a result, Chinese companies tend to use SEOs to adjust capital structure for the
purpose of balancing costs and benefits of financing by debts.

2.2.2 Growth Opportunities Theory

The availability of growth opportunities is one of the main reasons encourage
companies to issue equity. Company with growth opportunities favors equity
financing over debt financing to deter the transferring of wealth from
shareholders to debt holders (Myers, 1977). The mechanism of the wealth transfer
from shareholders to debt holders exists due to the assumption that company will
decide to bypass projects with positive net present value (NPV) if it has to finance
those projects by risky debts. When firms finance new projects with debts,
shareholders have to bear almost the entire cost in case of projects failure since
debt holders own priority claims in the firm assets. Besides, the project success
will raise the debt value (Huang, 2012). Furthermore, companies will face future
cash flow insecurity, which leads to financial health warning if they invest in high
uncertainty growth projects. Therefore, companies with more promising
opportunities have more tendencies to issue equity to buffer against any potential
financial constraints that might result from debt financing (Bo et. al., 2011).

Jensen (1986) argues that high growth rate companies with better projects will
more concern about overinvestment risk than bankruptcy risk, therefore they will
choose equity financing as optimal option. On contrary, Jeanneret (2003) states
that mature companies who have more free cash flow and capacity of debt
borrowing prefer debt financing to monitor and encourage managers’ role in
company.
                                       19




Research of Jung (1996); Jeanneret (2003); Elliot et. al (2008); Walker and Yost
(2008); Duca (2011); Alti and Sulaeman (2012) show that company uses the
proceeds gaining from SEOs to finance for its research and development
activities. Besides, company with more profitable projects prefers increasing its
financial resources by SEOs to debt to finance for its investment opportunities.
Therefore, the existence of those opportunities is one of motivations that
encourage company to conduct SEOs.

Bo et.al. (2011) examine SEOs motivation of Chinese companies suggests that
although study on Chinese stock market witness no support for investment and
growth financing theory, the tendency of profit-oriented and growth stage
situation of Chinese companies have revealed the role of this theory on this
market.

Besides, growth opportunities theory is also a theory that has strongly impact on
market reaction to company’s SEOs. Information about prospective projects is
seen as good news to investors and can create the trend of stock’s price increase
on the market. Tan et. al. (2002) shows that returns at Singapore market in the
period of the announcement increase significantly. They point out that conducting
SEOs conveys positive information about company prospective future, which
results in positive market’s reaction when the announcement is made available to
the market.

McConnell and Muscarella (1985) found that investors react positively to
company announcement of capital expenditure plan. Therefore, with the existence
of information asymmetry, the market’s reaction will respond to the ability of
company in signaling the prospective investment projects. In their research,
McConnell and Muscarella (1985) record positive reaction of investors toward
company announcement on its capital expenditure. Hence, they conclude that in
                                          20




case of information asymmetry existence, market reaction will depend on
company ability to signal to the market about the availability of profitable
projects. Cooney and Kalay (1993) prove that when the announcement is made
available, market would react positively if investors recognize the existence of
profitable projects, therefore, stock prices of high growth rate companies with
more investment projects are expected to rise when information about SEOs is
publicized. Dierken (1991), Pilotte (1992), Jung et. al. (1996) also find evidences
to support the theory that the existence of profitable projects will reduce the
probability of stock price reduction in the period of SEOs announcement. They
apply ratio of market value/book value and find that this ratio has significantly
positive correlation with stock returns in the period of right distribution
announcement.

Base on company’s dividend policy, Pilotte (1992) divides his research sample
into value companies group and growth companies group. Companies paying no
cash dividend are listed in high growth rate group, in contrast, companies paying
high or stable cash dividend are mature company. In the announcement period,
these mature companies witness significant decrease of stock price in comparison
to companies in the high growth rate group.

2.2.3 Market timing theory

The theory of market timing suggests that the time of stock price overvaluation
on the market will encourage managers to issue SEOs instead of other financing
methods. This will reduce the cost of companies while bring more benefit to
current stakeholders regardless of new shareholders; therefore, SEOs decision
will be related to mis-valuation proxies (Elliott et. al., 2008)

According to market timing theory, managers will exploit window of
opportunities when information asymmetry is at the lowest level. Korajczyk,
                                          21




Lucas and McDonald (1990) show that information asymmetry among internal
and external investors is not fixed, therefore company should choose the time
when information asymmetry is at the lowest level or to put it another way, when
the market is informed the most. In their research, they find that most of
companies conduct their SEOs after information about company earnings are
publicized. In addition, the further the time company publicizes information about
its activities from the issuance, the worse market reacts to company’s SEOs.

Berkovitch and Narayanan (1993) suggest that managers have superior
information about stock prices and will choose financing resources base on
conditions of the economy. During the favorable time, more external financing is
required, company could face lower adverse selection cost, consequently more
companies will choose equity financing as they predict better market condition. In
addition, the increase of total market capitalization will motivate company to
conduct SEOs due to the economic growth rate.

Choe et. al. (1993) find that most SEOs decisions are mostly made in favorable
time of the market. They suggest that managers will issue seasoned equity when
they find that the market timing is favorable. At this time, stock price is
considerably high; therefore, it can reduce the number of equity issued and
issuance fees. As the consequence, stock dilution becomes less severe because
less right distributions are distributed to outside investors.

There are clusters of SEOs when more growth opportunities available (Bayless
and Chaplinsky, 1996). Besides, the existence of opportunity window in the study
of Dereeper (2002) in French market show that the aggregate proceeds as well as
operation number have determined the concentration of equity issues .

Jeanneret (2003) suggests that when the economy condition is favorable,
companies experience more growth opportunities with less probability of failure,
                                        22




which lead to the reduction of overinvestment, agency cost and well as
information asymmetry. Manages, in returns are more motivated to issue SEOs in
this expansion business cycle.

Choosing market timing affect company’s SEOs decision; besides, it also
influences company stock price when information about SEOs is publicized.

Pilot researchers, Myers and Majluf (1984) demonstrate that company managers,
who are believed to have full information about company situation, are motivated
to issue seasoned equity when they find that the company stocks are overvalued.
The market, in return, will interpret this action and adjust company stock prices
when the information about the issuance is publicized.

Choe et. al. (1993) find that the extent of stock price decrease is smaller when the
market is favorable. Their reason is that: in the period of favorable market timing,
there are more profitable projects available, investors seem to care less about the
fact that company stocks are overvalued, less SEOs will be distributed to outside
investors. As the consequence, the extent of stock price decrease in period of
favorable market timing is smaller than that in unfavorable timing.

Choosing market timing can help company minimize the possibility of
overlooking potential investment projects if it has to finance these projects by
selling undervalued equities. Myers and Majluf (1984) point out that when
company is seeking external financial resources to finance its potential
investment projects, because its current cash flow is not enough and in case the
ability to borrow low interest rate loans does not exist, company will decide to
bypass these projects. They explain that because of the existence of information
asymmetry, conducting SEOs will lead to reduction in stock price when company
has to offer equities that are currently undervalued and can harm the interest of
current stakeholders. Choosing market timing when company stocks are
                                         23




overvalued lead to negative market reaction once information about SEOs is
publicized is also recorded in the research of Slovin (2000), Karbin and
Roosenboom (2002), Walker and Yost (2008) and Duca (2011).

Dereeper (2002) investigates the effect of market timing on equity issue
announcement in French stock market, however his results show no significant
effect during “cold” periods but during the “hot” period, it is significantly
negative. The author explains that because the French market is relatively smaller
in comparison to other market such as the US or UK, this will lead to difficulties
in attracting potential shareholders when the market is “hot”. As a consequence,
isolating their SEOs seems to be a better option to attract investor attention.

2.2.4 Agency problem theory:

Jensen and Meckling (1976) identify the existence of agency problem – the
problem derived from conflicts among stakeholders in joint-stock company,
caused by differences between property rights and management authorities. These
authors claimed that managers, shareholders and creditors have their own
purposes. Basically, shareholders expect managers to make decision that bring
benefit to shareholders; however, sometimes managers’ priorities are not
corresponding to shareholders’ priorities, their own targets may differ from
increasing the firm value. Because the purposes of managers are not always
corresponding to maximizing the company value, the owners of company may try
to monitor and control managers’ behaviors, these monitoring and controlling
actions results in agency costs of equity.

In the context of SEOs motivation, agency model predicts that to access to more
financial resources for private advantages, managers are encouraged to issue
SEOs; besides, they can use SEOs to expropriate the benefits of minority
shareholders (Bo et. al., 2011). This model also predicts that equity issues by
                                         24




companies that do not have valuable investment opportunities are bad news to
shareholders since they enhance managerial discretion when managers’ objectives
differ from shareholders’ objectives (Jung et. al., 1996).

Study on behavior of firms in developed markets mainly focus on managers and
shareholders conflicts and company SEOs motivation. The agency problem,
among the pecking order and market timing theory which justify company
financing decision has more power in explaining company behavior (Jung et al.,
1996). Their findings also show that some companies conduct SEOs to profit
managers rather than shareholders.

According to agency cost theory, debt plays two important roles. Firstly, debt can
reduce the severe differences between possession and management authority.
Secondly, debt issuance can create another conflict between shareholders and
creditors that could reduce company value on the market. When a lender provides
money to a company, the interest rate is formed based on the risk of that
company. Shareholders can make decision on company’s investment plans while
creditors only earn a certain interest. In case the project is successful,
shareholders can gain indefinite profit (Harris and Raviv, 1990), otherwise, when
the project failed, creditors will bear the risk of losing their money. To put it
another way, managers may tempt to transfer value from creditors to
shareholders, therefore the creditors will seek solutions to control the actions of
managers, these monitoring and controlling actions result in agency cost of debt.

2.2.5 Efficient Market Hypothesis

The Efficient Market Hypothesis suggests that stock price will reflect full current
information about the value of company, thus it is impossible for investors to
achieve returns in excess of average market returns by using that information.
This theory refers to a basic issue of financial market considering determinants
                                         25




affect stock price fluctuations and how to measure the mechanism of those
changing. The phrase “Market efficiency” first appeared in research of E. F.
Fama in 1965. According to the author, in an efficient market, because of fierce
competition among investors, when new information is made available to the
market, it can immediately lead to market reaction that could affect company’s
stock price.

Some investors try to identify undervalued equities and expect their prices to rise
in the future. Managers believe they can select potential equities that can generate
more profit than average market returns by using highly forecasting-techniques or
price-evaluation methods to support their investment decisions. However, the
market efficiency hypothesis states that there is no effective method exist that
could help investors successfully defeat the market, to say nothing of the
possibility that returns deriving from those highly technique methods cannot
excess costs generating from research expenses and trading costs.

The market efficiency hypothesis believes that gaining returns based on
forecasting the price fluctuation is difficult and impossible. The mechanism
behind stock price increase is the existence of new information. The market is
considered efficient when stock price immediately reacts when new information
is made available, thus it is impossible for stock price to be too high or too low in
comparison to its intrinsic value. Stock price will adjust before investors have
time to trade and gain excess returns from new information they have.

The fundamental reason of the existence of market efficiency is the fierce
competition among investors when they try to gain excess returns from new
information. The ability to detect mis-priced stock enables investors to buy stocks
that are currently undervalued in comparison to their core value then sell them to
gain excess returns. Many investors, including investment managers are confident
                                        26




about their ability to detect securities that will outperform the market; therefore,
they will spend time and efforts seeking opportunities to identify those equities.
When there are more investors join the market, the possibility to identify wrongly
evaluated stocks is reduced. Some “lucky investors” gain excess returns because
they can successfully identify stocks that are currently wrongly evaluated;
however, the remaining majority, on the other hand, have to bear costly
transaction costs that would likely outweigh the excess returns gained from their
trading.

Fama (1970) define three forms of market efficiency identified by the extent of
information reflection through stock price. The first form of market efficiency is
weak form where current stock price incorporates past information of company,
no one can identify mis-priced stocks and beat the market by analyzing company
past prices. The second form is Semi-strong form in which current stock price
does not only reflect historical information but also publicly available ones that
reported in company’s financial statements, or earnings and dividend
announcements, changing CEO, etc. If the market is semi-strong efficient, stock
price will immediately react to the release of new public information. The last
form is strong form in which current stock price fully reflects all existing
information of company including public and private information or internal
information.

SEOs can be considered new information to the market, the practice of issuing
seasoned equity becomes a channel to reflect “intention” of managers. Therefore,
researching on market’s reaction when company announces its SEOs can be
considered a test of the semi-strong form of market efficiency.

2.3 Literature review on SEOs empirical studies:

2.3.1 Determinants of company’s SEOs motivation:
2.3.1.1 Trade-off theory

Trade-off theory is one of the main theories on company capital structure and
draw a certain attention on company’s SEO motivation. Companies with higher
leverage in comparison to their optimal leverage have more tendencies to issue
SEOs in order to reduce their debt level (Marsh, 1982; Hovakimian et al.,2001)

Marsh (1982) applies logit regression technique to his research on 748 cases of
debt issuance and equity issuance at UK market from 1959 to 1970 find that
companies with high level of liability in comparison to its optimal liability has
tendency to conduct SEOs. Hovakimian et. al. (2001) also applies logit model to
analyze 39,387 SEO cases of United State companies from 1979 to 1997 and get
the same finding. Their results suggest that although past profits are an important
predictor of observed debt ratios, firms often make financing decisions that offset
these earnings driven changes in their capital structure. Specially, when firms
either raise or retire significant amounts of new capital, their choices move them
toward the target capital structures suggested by the trade-off models.

Trade-off theory is also testified at Chinese market where interest rate is one of
the most serious concerning issues because companies have to strongly rely on
loans from the banks (Huang and Song, 2006; Bo et. al., 2011, Huang, 2012). In
their study, Huang and Song (2006) apply logit model and find that Chinese
companies are especially interested in the benefits deriving from debt borrowing;
therefore, they will use SEOs as a method to customize capital structure of
company to balance the benefits and costs of debt borrowing. According to the
authors, based on trade-off theory, companies with high level of liability in
comparison to theirs optimal level of liability have tendency to conduct SEOs, in
                                        28




contrast, companies with low level of liability do not have that tendency because
they can raise their capital through loans from the banks to take advantage of tax
shield. However, Bo et. al. (2011) on listed Chinese companies from 1994 to
2008 also used logit model to investigate the compatibility of theories with SEOs
motivation find that trade-off theory plays no significant role on encouraging
company to offer its seasoned equity. They compare company i’s leverage to
average leverage of other companies in the same industry to proxy for trade-off
theory. According to the authors, company with higher leverage in comparison to
industry leverage will issue seasoned equity to reduce its leverage ratio; however,
they find no significant result on the influence of this ratio on company’s SEOs
decision. Huang (2012) use the average of the difference between company’s
leverage and their industry average leverage to proxy for trade-off theory to find
out whether the company has issue SEO in the sample period. His results show
that company with higher leverage in comparison to industry leverage tends to
issue SEOs.

Facio and Masulis (2005), Flannery and Rangan (2006), Frank and Goyal (2009)
show that each industry has different leverage ratio, managers use median of
industry leverage to proxy for target capital structure and consider it a reference
to adjust company leverage ratio. Jeanneret (2003) study at French stock market
using probit model, Elliot et. al (2008) applied logit model at U.S stock market
compare company leverage with median of industry leverage but do not find any
significant results to support the influence of trade-off theory on company’s SEOs
decision.

2.3.1.2 Growth Opportunities Theory

Investment opportunities play substantial role in SEOs decision. Applying logistic
model, Jung et. al. (1996) show a positive coefficient, indicating that companies

with more investment opportunities will be motivated to issue SEOs. Hovakimian
et. al. (2001) using the data from the 1997 Standard and Poor’s Compustat annual
file in the period of 1979 – 1999 found that firms experience large stock price
increases are more likely to issue equity than firms that experience stock price
declines due to the idea that stock price increase are generally associated with
improved growth opportunities, which could lower firm’s optimal debt ratio.
Elliot et. al (2008), Duca (2011), Alti and Sulaeman (2012) use ratio of R&D
expense/total assets to examine the effect of investment and growth opportunities
on company’s SEOs decision. Their results show that companies with more
investment and growth opportunities prefer SEOs to debt to finance for these
opportunities. Chikolwa and Kim (2009) examine case of SEOs by 34 Australian
Real Estate Trusts (A-REITs) during 2000 – 2008 to examine the effect of growth
opportunities on SEO issuance choice and find that growth opportunities have
significant positive relation with company’s SEOs motivation. Obtaining data for
U.S. Initial public offerings and SEOs between January 1st 1975 and December
31st 2007 from the Securities Data Company New Issues Database, Duca (2011)
examine determinants behind company’s SEOs motivation and find that
investment and growth opportunities have significantly positive correlation with
company’s SEOs decision. The TobinQ is applied as variable to proxy for growth
opportunities in these research, these authors suggest that the positive relation
between growth opportunities in a company and its SEOs decision is in line with
the predictions of capital structure theory (Duca, 2011). Elliot et. al (2008), Alti
and Sulaeman. (2012) use ratio of capital expenditure/total assets to proxy for
company investment and growth opportunities also record the same results.

However, Bo et. al. (2011) at Chinese stock market uses sales and fixed
investment annual growth rate which is measured as fixed assets to total assets
changing to proxy for investment and growth opportunities shows no significant
                                        30




relation between company’s SEOs motivation and growth opportunities theories,
which leads them to conclude that investment as well as growth opportunities
financing is not main motivations for Chinese companies to issue SEOs.

2.3.1.3 Market timing theory

Loughran and Ritter (1995) state that among financial policy theories, market
timing appear to be the most powerful theories in explaining the behavior of
managers to sell high price share supported by favorable market condition.

Eckbo et. al. (2007) find that when company decides to conduct SEOs, unless
new equities are distributed to current stakeholders, the issuance would dilute the
current shareholders ownership structure and result in transferring asset value of
current stakeholders to new stakeholders. In contrast, offering seasoned equities
that are overvalued will transfer asset value from new stakeholders to current
stakeholders, so company will choose to conduct SEOs when its market price is
higher than its intrinsic price (Duca, 2011). Choosing market timing is a
reasonable explanation for company to issue SEOs as an external financial
resource. Or to put it another way, one of the motivations for company to issue
SEOs is to exploit the market timing when company stocks are overvalued. This
result is confirmed by Bayless and Chaplinsky (1996), Salamudin et. al. (1999),
Jeanneret and Dubois (2004), Dittmar and Thakor (2007), Elliott et. al. (2008),
Bo et. al. (2011).

Salamudin et. al. (1999) base on term premiums to separate their sample find that
the economic conditions strongly affect the timing of rights issues. 56 cases out of
72 rights issues were made during the periods of falling term premiums with
significance of 1%, which leads them to conclude that companies tend to issue
rights issues when the market is favorable.
                                         31




Jeanneret (2003) research at French stock market using cumulative stock returns
in period preceding announcement day to proxy for market timing theory and
cumulative market returns before announcement day to evaluate the economy
condition before company make its decision on conducting SEOs. The author
finds that this proxy has positive correlation with company’s SEOs, supporting
the influence of market timing theory on SEOs motivation. Besides using
cumulative market returns before announcement day, the author also uses other
variables such as market volatility in the period of 75 days before announcement
day, differences between company 10-years bond and government 10-years bond
(Δcredit) as proxies to explain for the act of choosing market timing. However,
only Δcredit has significant statistic results, others play no remarkable roles on
company decision on conducting SEOs.

Dittmar and Thakor (2007) show that the high stock price will encourage
companies to conduct SEOs to exploit stock overvaluation and reduce the
information asymmetry. At the time, investors are also predicted to highly agree
with managerial decisions.

Elliott et. al. (2008) test the role of market timing theory in the security choice of
US companies show consistency with market timing theory. Companies with
over-valued equity have more possibility to issue SEOs, while the remaining tend
to issue debt. They conclude that market timing theory plays important role in
determining company financing resources.

Bo et. al. (2011) study at Chinese stock exchange in the period 1994 – 2008 find
that most of the case companies conduct SEOs is motivated by market timing
when the time is favorable. They used Market value/book value (M/B) as main
proxies to evaluate whether the market currently overvalues company stock and
                                       32




find that M/B ratio has positive correlation with probability that company will
issue SEOs.

However, DeAngelo et. al. (2010), Alti and Sulaeman (2012) show that market
timing is not a predominant theory to explain the motivation of company to
conduct SEOs. DeAngelo et. al. (2010) use a dataset of 27 years (1975–2001)
running on logit regressions to investigate industrial companies SEOs in US
market. They find that SEOs determination is not motivated by market timing but
the need on short-term cash for solving liquidity squeeze. Alti and Sulaeman
(2012) present that high stock returns accompany by shareholders strong demand
will motivate company to issue SEOs. On contrary, SEOs determination is not
strongly impacted.

2.3.1.4 Agency problem theory

To examine the effect of agency problem theory on company’s SEOs decision,
Huang (2012) use variables such as largest shareholder’s holding, ten largest
shareholders’ holding, percentage of non-tradable shares, managerial holding
include the board of directors, chairman, and the CEO to measure ownership
concentration in Chinese stock market. The author finds that these variables have
negative correlation with probability that company conducts SEOs. He also
concludes that ownership structure can lead to conflict between stakeholders in
company and affect company’s SEOs decision. Bo et. al. (2011) use extra
administrative expense which is calculated as difference between the firm’s
administrative expenses and average administrative expenses of all other firms in
the same industry excluding firm i in the same years to measure agency cost
between company managers and shareholders at Chinese stock market. According
to the authors, managers easily manipulate administrative expenses to protect
their controlling authority. The results show that extra administrative expenses
                                        33




have positive correlation with company’s SEOs decision. The authors explain that
the needs for administrative expenses are one of motivations of company to issue
seasoned equity. They also use ratio of non-tradable shareholdings to total shares
outstanding as proxy for conflict of interest between controlling and minority
shareholders. They assume that controlling managers use SEOs to expropriate
minority shareholders; therefore, this ratio will have positive correlation with
company SEOs probability. However, the final results show no relevance to
author expectations, which leads them to conclude that in case of Chinese stock
market, the SEOs motivation can be explained by other theories but agency cost
between controlling and minority stakeholders.

          (Appendix 1: Determinants of company’s SEOs motivation)


2.3.2 Market’s reactions to company’s SEOs
2.3.2.1 Growth Opportunities Theory

Denis (1994) investigates relation between growth opportunity and SEOs
evaluation show positive results as companies with more opportunities will
experience less price decline when information about SEOs is publicized. This
evidence has led the author to confirm the power of growth opportunity theory on
SEOs.

Jung et. al. (1996) find that companies with less investment opportunities will
experience more negative SEOs stock price reactions. They argue that in some
cases companies issue equity to serve managers instead of shareholders since
they enhance managerial discretion when managers’ objectives differ from
shareholders’ objectives. Consequences, SEOs companies with less investment
opportunities have the tendency to invest more than companies using debt, and
experience the worst stock price reactions.
                                        34




Salamudin et. al. (1999) conducted the research with 255 right distributions in
Malaysia Stock market suggest that investors expect that money from the
issuance will be spent on profitable projects at potential developing countries
with high economic growth. They assume that the economic condition presents
the existence of investment opportunities and witness a significant increase of
stock price when the market is favorable.

Walker and Yost (2008) use the SEOs sample from Thomson Financial's
Corporate New Issues database in the period of 1997 -2000 including 438
companies find that companies are mostly motivated to issue equity to increase
investment. Besides, firm's statements will affect market reactions. This
conclusion is relevant to these findings since the purpose of new funding is to
increase company value. The market, in return will interpret company’s
statements. Companies will experience positive returns when they announce
specific investment information while not to be detailed information can lead to
negative reaction as the market interpret the funding is not be used for company
value increasing projects.

Ambarish et. al. (1987) suggest that the availability of company growth prospects
will affect stock price announcement reaction, mature firms with limited growth
opportunities are predicted to have negative response while a positive response is
expected for growth firms, Owen and Suchard (2008) using the data of 207 right
distributions from Australian stock market in the period 1993 – 2001 to examine
the relation between company’s growth opportunities and the announcement
returns, however their findings show no significant results.

Aggarwal and Zhao (2008) break their samples by growth opportunities using the
market-to-book ratio and company industry (whether a firm belongs to a high-
tech industry) to examine the relation between company’s growth opportunities
                                         35




and SEOs announcement effect. With the case of 8127 SEOs observations from
the Securities Data Corporation (SDC) New Issues database during the period
1983 to 2003, their results hold the same among each subgroup, which lead them
to conclude that growth opportunities do not play significant role on SEOs
announcement returns.

Duca (2011) examines SEOs in the United States over the period of 1980-2007
and find that with regards to firm characteristics, announcement returns are lower
for riskier firms, but higher for those with a larger stock runup and TobinQ.
According to the author, those proxies signal growth opportunities with the
results of significant impact on announcement effects of SEOs.

2.3.2.2 Market timing theory

Research on SEOs conducted at different countries show that market condition
plays significant role on company’s SEOs decision and market reaction in term of
stock price fluctuation on event day as well. In the period of favorable market
timing, there are more investment projects available, less market uncertainty,
investors seem to care less about the fact that stocks are currently overvalued.

Masulis and Korwar (1986) apply cumulative stock returns in the period of three-
month before announcement (RUNUP) and cumulative market returns in the
same period (MRUNUP) as proxies for market timing condition when a company
is likely to make a common stock offering. They find that less anticipated SEOs
announcement information will lead to negative stock returns. Large price run-up
predicts less possibility of SEOs issuance since high pre-announcement stock
returns can reduce company leverage, which leads to the reduction of company
tendency to lower their debt by conducting SEOs. In their research, they also
apply company risk measurement as proxy for the uncertainty find that market
react negatively to company SEOs announcement when the uncertainty increase.
                                        36




Salamudin et. al. (1999) study at Malaysia stock market shows that, in the period
of favorable market timing, stock price is in the tendency of increasing while in
unfavorable timing, it witnesses price falling. The authors calculate the volatility
before announcement day as an indicator for the risk of the market with the
expectation that the higher the volatility, the worse market’s reaction to stock
price since this timing is not favorable. Besides, they also use dummy variable (as
it is equal to 1 if the market condition is favorable and equal 0 otherwise) and
cumulative market returns before announcement day to proxy for market
condition The author explains that investors expect the financial proceeds from
the issuance will be used to finance for profitable projects at high growth rate
developing countries; therefore, they are motivated to join the issuance.

Elliott et. al. (2008) examine SEOs of US firms that issued public seasoned equity
during the period 1980–1999. They find that choosing market timing successfully
will help SEOs issuing company reduce its issuance cost and bring profit to
current stakeholders regardless that of new stakeholders. They conclude that
choosing market timing will affect company stock price reaction on the market.

Balachandra (2008) examines British SEOs argues that to buffer against stock
price overvaluation, investors will demand a certain price discount; therefore,
there should be a positive relation between price discount and risk idiosyncrasy,
so the higher the risk is, the higher price discount company should offer to
investors to compensate for the risk increase they might suffer.

In the research at Vietnamese stock exchange of Ho Viet Tien and Dinh Thi Thu
Ha (2012), the authors divide their data sample according to market condition
based on the differences between VNIndex in the beginning and at the end of the
fiscal year. Their results show that stock returns around ex-right day in the period
                                          37




of favorable market condition are significant higher than those in the period of
unfavorable market condition.

2.3.2.3 Efficiency market hypothesis:

The extent of stock prices reaction to SEOs announcement depends on the
informational efficiency of the market.

Empirical studies conducted at developed countries such as USA, United
Kingdom, The Netherlands, Australia show evidence of superior stock price
performance prior to the SEOs announcement but then deteriorates after the
offering announcement and becomes significantly negative during the decision
period. The interpretation for this negative action is the existence of information
asymmetry in company (Myers and Majluf, 1984; Miller and Rock, 1985; Slovin
et. al., 2000, Karbin and Roosenboom, 2002; Walker and Yost, 2008; Duca,
2011), reduction of manager ownership structure (Masulis and Korwar, 1986),
agency cost problem (Jung et. al., 1996), increasing pressure on company stock
price (Aggarwal, 2008; Chikolwa and Kim 2009), problem derived from the act
of overinvestment of managers (Karbin and Roosenboom, 2002). Other
researchers such as Balachandran (2008), Owen and Suchard (2008), Eric Duca
(2011) show that company will offer an issuance price which is lower than its
market price to compensate for investors (Eric Duca, 2011), to avoid expenses
that could ruin the issuance (Balachandran, 2008), or make it as a motivation
method to encourage investors to get involved in the issuance (Owen and
Suchard, 2008)

However, research at developing market are not consistent. While research of
Tsangarakis (1996) at Greece market, Dhatt (1996) at Korean stock market,
Salamudin et. al. (1999) at Malaysia stock market and Marisetty et. al. (2008) at
Indian stock market reveal significant increase of returns in announcement
                                        38




period. This trend is explained by the reduction in agency cost (Tsangarakis,
1996), a decrease in financial distress cost (Dhatt, 1996), investors’ expectation
that financial proceeds from the issuance will be used to finance for profitable
projects at high growth rate developing countries (Salamudin et. al., 1999) or the
increase of company liquidity (Marisetty et. al.,2008)

Cahit (2006) examines market’s reaction to announcement of “unsweetened”
(plain) and “sweetened” (with simultaneous distribution of bonus issues) rights
offerings in the Istanbul Stock Exchange show that “unsweetened” method
conveys negative information about company future activities such as liquidity,
dividend policy as well as investment activities; in contrast, company using
“sweetened” method brings positive information such as company performance,
cash flow and investment opportunities to the market.

On contrast, research at Chinese stock market of Chen et al. (2007), Shahid
(2010) and at Thailand stock exchange of Leskullawat (2011) witness a decrease
in stock price due to the price pressure that the issuance might bring to the
market.

Vo Xuan Vinh and Dang Buu Kiem (2016) examine market reaction measured by
abnormal trading volume around the XR day on HOSE find that dividend
payment also affects investors. In the period before XR day, trading volume
increases abnormally, which is inconsistent with efficiency market hypothesis
where dividend payment will not affect company value because price and trading
volume on announcement day have already fully reflected all the information of
the company.

      (Appendix 3: Determinants of market reaction to company’s SEOs).

In figure 2.1, we recapitulate financial theories into a conceptual framework. We find that Trade-off, Agency
problem, Growth opportunities and Market timing are main theories influence determinants of company’s SEOs
motivation. While Growth opportunities, Market timing and Efficient market hypothesis are main theories
concerning market reaction and determinants of market reaction to company SEOs.

2.4      Hypotheses building:
      Based on our literature review in both theoretical and empirical studies in
      section 2.2 and 2.3, in this section we will build the hypotheses.
2.4.1    Determinants of company’s SEOs motivation:
Company issues SEOs to adjust its capital structure toward an optimal structure in
order to reach the balance between benefit and expense generated from debt
borrowing. Any deviation from this balance will require an adjustment and SEOs
can be considered a tool to do that mission. The optimal capital between debt and
equity structure in a company can be determined by trading off the costs and
benefits between debt and equity financing. Companies’ choices of capital
structure, therefore moves them toward an optimal one which is suggested by the
trade-off theory.
To testify the influence of trade-off theory on company’s SEOs decision, industry
leverage ratio is considered as in the research of Marsh (1982), Hovakimian et. al.
(2001), Jeanneret (2003), Facio and Masulis (2005), Flannery and Rangan (2006),
Huang and Song (2006), Frank and Goyal (2009), Bo et. al. (2011) and Huang
(2012) since each industry is typical with each business situation that could affect
company’s SEOs motivation. In this study, we apply the difference between
company’s leverage ratio and average of industry’s leverage ratio (Difference In
Leverage Ratio - DILR) as proxy for trade-off theory to examine its effect on
company’s SEOs motivation. This proxy is expected to have positive sign with
the probability that company will conduct SEOs since company with higher
leverage than companies in the same industry will have more motivation to issue
SEOs to reduce its leverage ratio.

H1: The difference between company’s leverage ratio and average of industry’s
leverage ratio (DILR) has positive impact on company’s SEOs.
                                        41




Companies with more growth opportunities will need more financial resources to
finance those opportunities. In comparison to debt financing, equity financing can
help companies to prevent wealth transfer from shareholders to debt holders, and
to buffer against any potential financial constraints that might result from debt
financing. Therefore, according to growth opportunities theory, the existence of
profitable opportunities is one of motivations encourage companies to issue
SEOs, especially the companies with better, bigger and more investment projects.
Follow the research examining the effect of growth opportunities theory on
company’s SEOs decision of Jung (1996), Jeanneret (2003), Elliot et. al. (2008),
Kim and Weisbach (2008), Walker and Yost (2008), Duca (2011), Bo et. al.
(2011), Alti and Sulaeman (2012), Huang (2012), in this research we apply
TobinQ ratio as proxy for the trade-off theory and expect this proxy to have
positive correlation with probability that company will conduct SEOs. We believe
that company with more investment opportunities will be motivated to conduct
SEOs to finance those opportunities.

H2: Companies with higher TobinQ ratio are more likely to issue SEOs.


Managers will choose the time when market is overvaluing company stock prices
to conduct SEOs. Choosing market condition at this time can help company lower
issuance cost, benefit current shareholders, reduce the possibility that new equity
issued be transferred to outside stakeholders, besides there are more numerous
investment projects available, so equity issue become less costly than other types
of external financial resources. Market condition, therefore, significantly affects
company decision on conducting SEOs.
Follow Jung et. al. (1996), Salamudin et. al. (1996), Jeanneret (2003), Eckbo et.
al. (2007), Elliott et. al. (2008), DeAngelo et. al. (2010), Bo et. al. (2011), Duca
                                        42




(2011), Alti and Sulaeman (2012) to testify the effect of market timing theory on
company SEOs motivation, in this study, we apply ratio of Market value/Book
value as proxy for market condition before the issuance. This proxy is expected to
have positive relation with the probability that company issue SEOs since
company will exploit window of opportunity when market condition is favorable
to conduct SEOs.

H3: Companies with higher ratio of M/B are more likely to issue SEOs



According to Agency problem thery, ownership structure can lead to conflicts
among related stakeholders and will affect manager’s decision in choosing the
capital structure in a company. Because SEOs can enhance managerial discretion
in company, once managers’ objectives differ from shareholders’ objective, they
can use SEOs to get more financial resources at hands to exploit the benefit of
minority shareholders and to gain more controlling power. Consequently, Agency
problem theory plays important role on company’s SEOs motivation.
To examine effect of Agency problem theory on SEOs motivation, as in the
research of Jung et. al. (1996), Bo et. al. (2011), Huang (2012), in this study we
use the ratio of managerial holding include the board of directors, board of
supervisor, president and CEO (Ratio of Managerial Holding - RMH) to proxy
for agency problem theory. We expect this ratio to have positive sign with
probability that company conduct SEOs since managers will use SEOs as a tools
to benefit themselves at the expense of minority shareholders.

H4: The ratio of managerial holding (RMH) positively affects company’s SEOs
decisions.
                                         43




2.4.2   Market’s reaction to company’s SEOs:

Efficient Market Hypothesis suggest that stock price will entirely reflect current
information about the value of company, thus it is impossible for investors to
achieve returns in excess of average market returns by using that information. In
case of company’s SEOs, because the practice of issuing seasoned equity can be
considered new information to the market, researching on market reaction when
company announces its SEOs can be considered a test of the semi-strong form of
efficient market where the current stock prices can reveal not only company
historical information but also the current ones since they becomes a channel to
reflect “intention” of managers.

In our research, we assume that HOSE is efficient in semi-strong form which is a
popular efficiency form in emerging markets. This means that SEOs
announcements do not have impact on market’s reaction, there are no abnormal
returns on event day: AAR = 0

H5: HOSE is efficient in semi-strong form.


According to Growth opportunities theory, information about prospective projects
is seen as good news to the market. Because investors always concern whether
new funds be used in value increasing manner, therefore the existences of those
projects can pursue them to believe that companies do use money from new
issuance to invest in valuable projects without enhancing managerial discretion.
Consequently, market reaction will respond to company’s ability in signaling the
prospective investment projects. The more growth opportunities companies can
signal to the market, the better market reacts to their SEOs.
To examine the impact of Growth opportunities theory on market reaction to
company’s SEOs as in research of McConnell and Muscarella (1985), Ambarish
                                         44




et. al. (1987), Pilotte (1992), Jung et. al. (1996), Salamudin et. al. (1999), Tan et.
al. (2002), Aggarwal and Zhao (2008), Walker and Yost (2008), Owen and
Suchard (2008), Chiolwa (2009), Duca (2011) and Officer (2011, in our study we
use TobinQ ratio as proxy for Growth opportunities theory and expect it will have
positive relation with company’s stock abnormal return. We assume that
companies with more investment opportunities can attract more investors to buy
their SEOs, which leads to positive market reaction when information about
SEOs is publicized.
H6a: TobinQ positively affects market reaction on announcement day
H6b: TobinQ positively affects market reaction on XR day



When the market condition is favorable, investors seem to care less about the fact
that company stock prices are probably overvalued; besides, this condition also
signal about more investment projects available, less market uncertainty and more
probability that companies will use new capital gaining from the issuance to
increase shareholder value by investing in those projects. Consequently, the more
favorable market condition will lead to more positive market reaction to
company’s SEOs.

To testify the effect of market timing theory on market reaction to company’s
SEOs, the market condition will be considered as in the research of Masulisand
Korwar (1986), Choe et. al. (1993), Tsangarakis (1996), Salamudin et. al. (1999),
Slovin (2000), Karbin and Roosenboom (2002), Jeanneret (2003), Elliott et. al.
(2008), Balachandra et. al. (2008), Walker and Yost (2008), Duca (2011), Ho
Viet Tien and Dinh Thi Thu Ha (2012). In this study, we apply MRUNUP as
proxy for market condition and expected this proxy to have positive relation with
company’s stock abnormal return. We believe that the better the market condition
                                        45




is, the better the market’s reaction to company SEOs since more investors will be
motivated to join the issuance.

H7a: MRUNUP has positive impact on market reaction on announcement day
H7b: MRUNUP has positive impact on market reaction on XR day


2.5   Conclusion:

This section surveys various contents relating to SEOs studies in term of
determinants of SEOs motivation, market reaction and determinants of market
reaction to company’s SEOs in developed and emerging markets. The literatures
on SEOs have shown that the Trade-off theory; Agency problem theory; Growth
opportunities theory; and Market timing theory is the most relevant and important
theories.

When companies consider making SEOs decision, they will try to move towards
an optimal capital structure to balance the benefits and costs of debt as mentioned
by trade-off theory; to use SEOs as a tool for controlling or managing power that
resulted from conflicts among stakeholders as assumed by agency problem
theory. Besides, companies with more growth opportunities tend to issue SEOs to
finance for those projects and reduce the possibility of wealth transfer from
shareholders to debt holders and they are motivated to issue SEOs when they find
that companies’ stock prices are currently overvalued which can be considered
favorable market timing.

Market reacts differently when company announces its SEOs. Research
conducted at developed countries such as USA, United Kingdom, The
Netherlands, Australia show significant decrease in stock price in the period of
SEOs announcement. However, results at developing market are not consistent.
While research of Tsangarakis (1996) at Greece market, Dhatt (1996) at Korean
                                         46




stock market, Marisetty et. al. (2008) at Indian reveal significant increase of
returns in announcement period, research at Chinese stock market of Chen et al.
(2007), Shahid (2010) and at Thailand stock exchange of Leskullawat (2011)
witness a decrease in stock price. Salamudin et. al. (1999) study at Malaysia stock
market shows that, in the period of favorable market timing, stock price is in the
tendency of increasing while in unfavorable timing, it witnesses price falling.

When approaching research on SEOs, event study is one of the main methods to
examine market reaction to SEOs announcement. However, they ignore other
events that could strongly influence stock price of SEOs companies such as the
ex-right day. With the characteristic of this day, stock price on the market will be
technically adjusted corresponding to the number of equity issued; besides, the
number of SEOs have not been actually transferred to investors’ accounts.
Therefore, the longer the period of stock transference, the higher the possibility of
stock price decrease. Hence, identifying the main events that effect stock price
reaction to form an overall picture about SEOs is necessary. In comparison to
previous research, in this research, besides announcement day, the ex-right day
will also be examined as one of main events in the case of Vietnamese stock
market.

                                  CHAPTER 3

                         DATA AND METHODOLOGY.

3.1 Data

This research covers only listed companies on the Ho Chi Minh City Stock
Exchange (HOSE) during 2007 – 2013. Price of stocks are collected from HOSE
website. If t is the year of the SEOs announcement, independent variables are
extracted from companies’ t-1 annual reports.

We impose the following restrictions to construct our SEO data set for each SEO
observation in year t:

    Only SEOs information is publicized on the website of State Securities
       Commission of Vietnam www.ssc.gov.vn or website of Ho Chi Minh city
       Stock Exchange https://www.hsx.vn are included.
    Companies must have stock price data available 66 days before the
       announcement day and 15 days after the ex-right day.
    Company market capitalization must be available in the HOSE database on
       December 31 as of year t−1.
    Companies’ accounting data in year t-1 must be available in the Orbis
       database.
    We exclude financial companies due to the differences in their financial
       statements structure to that of the remaining companies.

We collect the data for companies conducted SEOs (SEOs cases hereafter) which
includes 482 cases and companies did not conduct SEOs (non-SEOs cases
hereafter) which was 532 cases. To approach the first research objective to
examine behavior of listed companies, we will use all the data for both SEOs
                                        48




cases and non-SEOs cases, while to approach the second objective to examine
behavior of investors, we will apply the data for SEOs cases only.

Our research sample comprises companies conducting their SEOs as right
distributions; or rights accompanied with dividends; or rights accompanied with
bonuses; and companies issued their seasoned equity as bonuses or dividends.

The event days include announcement day and ex-right day, which are widely
publicized on the media.

SEOs companies are classified according to three criteria (market capitalization,
issuance method and industry).

Capitalization values of the companies are divided into three groups: companies
with big, medium and small capitalization values based on standards suggested by
The Morning Star. Companies with big market capitalization are the biggest ones
whose stock values account for 70% of the market capitalization; medium
companies account for the next 20% and the small ones hold the remaining 10%.
Times of classifying are 29/12/2006; 28/12/2007; 31/12/2008; 31/12/2009,
31/12/2010, 30/12/2011 and 31/12/2012

Companies issue their SEOs method as right distributions; or rights accompanied
with dividends; or rights accompanied with bonuses are grouped in equity rights
issues. The other group is equity bonuses or dividends comprises companies
issued their SEOs as bonuses or dividends.

The HOSE classification criteria and principles divide listed companies into 12
groups of industry (see http://www.hsx.org.vn), and in this research they are re-
divided into four groups (exclude group of financial companies): (1) Real estate
and construction; (2) Manufacturing industry (mining, processing, electricity
production and distribution, natural gas, boiler, steamer and air conditioner; (3)
                                      49




Service (wholesaling, retailing, repair of vehicles and engines, transport,
warehousing, accommodating, food and drink supply, communication and
information, scientific and professional services); and (4) Agriculture, Fishery
and Forestry.

2007 was considered the “brightest” years in HOSE history, VNIndex ended at
927.0 point, increasing 175.2 points from 751.8 point in 2006 before significant
decrease to 315.6 in the end of 2008, then followed by fluctuation from 351.6
point to 504.6 point in the period 2009-2013. The highest score of VNIndex was
also recorded in 2007. Besides, in this year, the Vietnamese stock exchange was
supported by favorable condition of macro economy condition; therefore, listed
companies did exploit the market condition to collect money from the issuance
when choosing equity rights as method to conduct their SEOs. In 2007, the
number of companies conducting SEOs through this method account for 63.54%
of total SEOs cases.

In contrast, in other years, when the economy was not that favorable, raising
capital encountered difficulties resulting from common market condition,
investors less care about the stock market and were not willing to invest more
money into stock market, issuing SEOs by equity bonuses or dividends were
considered the best choice to attract investors. Therefore, the number of SEOs
issuing by this method outweigh the number of SEOs issuing by equity rights.
This fact confirms that SEOs companies do choose market timing when making
decision on conducting their SEOs.

                (Source: www.ssc.gov.vn & data.worldbank.org)

The majority of SEOs was mainly conducted by small companies, accounting for
more than 54% of total issuances. This situation might result from the fact that
small companies were in the shortage of needed funds and/or they lack of
capability to approach loans from banks, which motivated those companies to
raise money by issuing SEOs.

When dividing SEOs conducting companies into 4 different groups, the number
of SEOs companies listed in Manufacturing group did outweigh the number of
the other groups.

    3.2 Methodology:

         3.2.1 Determinants of company’s SEOs motivation:

    To examine determinants of company’s SEOs decision, two main techniques
    have been applied are:

           Logit regression technique, which has been used in the research of Jung et.
           al. (1996), Elliott et. al. (2008), DeAngelo et. al. (2010), Abraham et. al.
           (2011), Hong Bo et. al. (2011), Huang (2012).

           Probit regression technique which has been applied by Jeanneret (2003),
           Chikolwa and Kim (2009), Eric Duca (2011), Alti and Sulaeman (2012).

    In our research, we apply both logit and probit model to identify determinants of
    company’s SEOs decision. According to Gujarati (2012), in practice, there is no
    compelling reason to choose one over the other since the results regressed from
    the logit and probit model are almost identical. Many researchers choose the logit
                                             52




over the probit because of its comparative mathematical simplicity while others
tend to use probit model because they favor the normality assumption for error
term in probit model, while in the logit model, the error term has the logistic
distribution.
                                                           ∗
Given the assumption of normality, the probability             is less than or equal to
can be computed from the standard normal cumulative distribution function as:
                           ∗
  = Pr(Y=1|X) = Pr(            ≤ ) = Pr(   ≤ BX) = F(BX)                         (3.1)

Where Pr(Y|X) means the probability that an event occurs (in this case is SEOs)
given the values of the X variables and where Z is the standard normal variable. F
is the standard normal cumulative distribution function, which in the present
context can be written as:

    (      )=                    /
                      ∫                                                          (3.2)
                √

Since P represents the probability that a company conducts SEOs, it is measured
by the area of the standard cumulative distribution function curve from -∞ to .
In the present context, F( ) is called the probit function (Gujarati, 2012)

We select proxies for concerned theories to test the explanation power of standard
theory in explaining SEOs motivation in Vietnamese context:

The dependent variable is the probability that company issues its seasoned equity
offering            , taking the value of one if the firm i conducts SEOs in year t, and
zero otherwise.

The independent variables include:

             The difference between company’s leverage ratio and average of
                industry’s leverage ratio (Difference In Leverage Ratio - DILR) is
                used as proxy for trade-off theory
                              53




 To examine the effect of growth opportunity on company’s SEOs
   decision, TOBINQ ratio will be applied.
 Ratio of market value/Book value (M/B) is used as proxy for market
   condition before the issuance.
 In terms of Agency problem, ratio of managerial holding include
   the board of directors, board of supervisor, president and CEO
   (Ratio of Managerial Holding - RMH) will be applied as proxy for
   this theory.
 FIRMSIZE; D/A; PROFITABILITY are applied as controlling
   variables.
   According to Huang (2012), the larger the company is, the more
   stable its incomes are, therefore those companies easily approach to
   loan resources so the probability that those companies conduct
   SEOs is less likely to happen. Elliot et. al (2008) shows that the
   larger the company is, the more transparent it is; besides,
   company’s assets are more stable and could help company easily
   approach to low interest rate loans, therefore those companies will
   favor debt borrowing over conducting SEOs. We expect that the
   size of company have negative correlation with probability that
   company issues SEOs. To measure firm size, follow Jung et. al.
   (1996), Chikolwa and Kim (2009), Bo et. al. (2011), Alti and
   Sulaeman (2012); Huang (2012) we use logarithm of total assets to
   proxy for this variable.


   Bo et. al. (2011) use ratio of total liability/total assets to examine
   the effect of debt on company’s SEOs decision. Their results show
   that this ratio has positive correlation with probability that company
                           54




issue seasoned equity. Jung et. al (1996), Elliot et. al. (2008),
Chikolwa and Kim (2009), Abraham et. al (2011) use this ratio to
examine the influence of debt on company’s SEOs. According to
Abraham et. al (2011), the increase of long-term debt can affect risk
management activities in company. Debt itself contains a certain
level of risk which could reduce the capability of using company
future cash flow, company with promptly increase in debt
borrowing will not favor borrowing more debt but issuing seasoned
equity instead to support its financial needs.


Company profitability is considered an internal resource of
company and used as proxy for pecking order theory. According to
the previous research, the more profitable the company is, the
higher internal resources company has; therefore, company does not
have to excess external resources such as loans borrowing or
conducting SEOs. Bo et. al., (2011), Huang (2012) measure the
impact of company profitability on managers’ SEOs decision on
Chinese stock exchange with the hypothesis that the higher internal
returns company has; the less likely it is to get excess to external
resources such as loans borrowing or issuing SEOs but their results
show that company profitability has positive correlation with SEOs
decision which is not relevant to pecking order theory expectation.
However, according to these authors, in order to issue SEOs,
company has to have profit in issuance year; therefore, the fact is
that company profitability has positive relations with company’s
SEOs motivation is acceptable. Jeanneret (2003), Chikolwa and
Kim (2009) use ROA to proxy for company profitability, however
                                        55




            the results is controversial, results of Jeanneret (2003) at French
            stock market is relevant to author initial expectation as company
            profitability has negative correlation with company probability of
            conducting SEOs while findings of Chikolwa and Kim (2009) show
            converse results. Elliott et. al., (2008); Alti and Sulaeman (2012)
            study at U.S stock market expect that company profitability have
            negative correlation with probability that company issue SEOs.
            They explain that due to pecking order theory, company with high
            profitability will have less motivation to issue SEOs since it already
            has enough internal financial resources to finance its needs. Another
            explanation for this negative correlation is that company with high
            profitability will have to pay higher tax; therefore, it will borrow
            more loans to exploit the benefit of tax shield.

3.2.2 Market reaction to company’s SEOs

3.2.2.1 Event study:

The Event study method which was developed by Campbell, Lo and MacKinlay
(1997) will be applied to investigate market reaction to SEOs.

Step 1: Event definition

Identifying what event should be considered and the period in which stock price
is affected is the first step of the process. It is a period over which the event
occurs – which is called event window. The event window usually has one day,
however if the information is announced at the time of stock market closing, the
event window will last for one more day. Besides, periods before and after the
event occurrence are also be examined when conducting research on SEOs. In
our research, Announcement day and Ex-Right day will be chosen as event days.

Step 2: Selection criteria

After identifying the event be paid attention to, the next step is to determine
criteria to select companies in the sample. These criteria are depended on the
data available on the market or market’s regulation toward some industries.
Therefore, it will be better to specifically illustrate the data characters such as
company market capitalization, industry that company represents, frequency of
                                          57




market distribution …because these characters could bias the results. This
research covers only listed companies on the Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange
(HOSE) during 2007 – 2013 where SEOs companies are classified according to
three criteria (market capitalization, issuance method and industry).

Step 3: Normal and abnormal return measurement

According to Brown and Warner (1980), a security’s price performance can only
be considered ‘abnormal’ relative to a particular benchmark. Thus, it is
necessary to specify a model generating ‘normal’ returns before abnormal
returns can be measured. The abnormal return for a given security in any time
period is defined as the difference between its actual ex post return and the return
which is predicted under the assumed return-generating process. In this step, we
will clarify measurements of the abnormal return (AR), the average abnormal
return (AAR) and the cumulative abnormal return (CAR) which are strongly
related to SEOs research.

Abnormal return - AR:

Consider day t = 0 is the day when the event occurs, with any stock i, the return -
Rit of stock i in period t will be related to event day as followed:

                                   Rit = Kit +  it                          (3.3)

Where Kit is defined as normal return or expected return, and  it represents
abnormal or unexpected return.

Thus, abnormal return is formed by difference between actual return and

expected return:                                it = R – K                  (3.4)
                                                       it  it



To put it another way,  it is difference between return that depends on the event
and expected return that does not depend on the event. Therefore, calculating
                                          58




abnormal return means calculating the unexpected changing in investor’s asset
value that related to a certain event. So, selecting a parameter model as well as
estimation period are important steps in Event study process. There are three
commonly used models concerning event study:

a) Mean Adjusted Returns

The mean adjusted model claims that the expected return of stock i is equal to its
average returns in period [T1,T2] and that return is constant.



                               ( ) = ∑T2
                                      t=T1 Rit                               (3.5)

Where T= T2 – T1 + 1

The actual return of stock i in the period t is equal to Rit.

Thus, abnormal return is the difference between actual return and expected

return E(Ri):
                                          it = R – E(R )                 (3.6)
                                                 it    i


b) Market Adjusted Returns

The biggest disadvantage of mean adjusted returns model is that it bypasses the
impact of market condition on stock price fluctuation, which could lead to the
consequence that the existence of abnormal return is caused by the impact of
market overall situation but not by the event. To fulfill this disadvantage, the
market adjusted returns has been applied with market parameter -       be used as
a proxy for market benchmark.

Because market portfolio (M) includes all kind of stocks with different risk
levels, therefore, the expected return of stock i in period t is equal to expected
return of M:                           E(Rit)= Rmt                        (3.7)
                                               59




Thus, abnormal return of stock i is the difference between its actual return and

actual return of market portfolio representative:  it = Rit – Rmt       (3.8)

c) Market model, CAPM model and three factors model of Fama and French

       Market model

Market adjusted returns model assumes that every stock has beta coefficient
equal to 1, which is not always true in reality. Therefore, paying attention to
differences in beta coefficient of each stock is necessary when defining abnormal
return. A better way to define abnormal return is considered it an excess part of
market model:

                                           =       +       +            (3.9)

Where:

     R : actual return of stock i in period t.

         : stable return of stock i

         : slope of stock i

           : market portfolio returns in period t.

Thus, abnormal return is the excess return or unexpected return

                                       =       −       −                (3.10)

       CAPM model

Another approach to measure expected return is based on CAPM model, where
expected return of stock i is defined as:

                               =       +       (       −   )+            (3.11)

Where:
                                          60




     R : return of stock i in period t

           : risk free rate

     Rmt: market portfolio returns in period t

         : beta coefficient of stock i

Therefore, abnormal returns is equal  it =      -    -   (   -   )    (3.12)

       Three factor model of Fama and French

Measuring market return based on market model or CAPM model is precise
when the effect of the event does not prolong. To research on event whose effect
could extend in a long time, the three factors model of Fama and French (1996)
has been applied to measure expected return. This model extends market model
by applying factors of the firm size (SMB) and firm book value (HML) into its
model.

                =      +         −        +          +ℎ       +       (3.13)

Where:

     R : the portfolio's expected rate of return

     R : risk-free return rate

     R : market portfolio expected return

     SMB (“small minus big”): historic excess returns of small caps over big
         caps

     HLM (“high minus low”): historic excess returns of value stocks over
         growth stocks

     β : beta coefficient of market portfolio
                                            61




       s : coefficient of SMB.

       h : coefficient of HML.

Therefore, abnormal return is equal:

             =      −      −          −          −              −ℎ           (3.14)

Although there are some differences among the three approaches, the results are
equivalent. Dyckman et. al. (1984) show that the three models have the same
ability in discovering abnormal performance existence. Korajczyk, Lucas and
McDonald (1990) find that “the basic pattern of abnormal returns around
announcement day of equity issues is similar across all methods of calculating
abnormal returns” and “the correlations are generally high (0.85 – 0.99) when
comparing the results using different methods.

Follow Salamudin et. al. (1999),          to calculate the abnormal return, we used
market adjusted model with the assumption that the expected return of stock i on
day t equals to the return of market portfolio and measured by VNIndex.
The abnormal return is defined as:          =        -
(3.15)
Where,         is the abnormal return of stock i on day t;           is actual return of
stock i on day t;       is market return on day t.



Average Abnormal Returns – AAR

Average Abnormal Returns of companies that are affected by the event is defined
                                                         N
as:                                  AARt  (1/ N ) ARit                    (3.16)
                                                         i 1


Where:
                                       62




    AARt: average abnormal return on day t

    N is the number of issues in the sample.

    ARit: abnormal return of stock i on day t

Cumulative Abnormal Returns – CAR

A popular method to examine the abnormality of a stock when event day cannot
be clarified is to use cumulative abnormal returns.

Cumulative abnormal return is expressed as CAR is calculated by summing
average abnormal returns in observed period.

                                               L
                                CAR( K , L )   AARt
                                             tK                          (3.17)

This method was formed by Fama, Fisher, Jensen and Roll (1969), it focuses on
the excess returns of stocks that cannot be estimated around event day.

Step 4: Estimation procedure

Once normal and abnormal returns measurements have been selected, the next
step is to choose estimation window which is necessary period to estimate
parameters. The most common choice, when feasible, is using the period prior to
the event window for the estimation window. Normally, the event window
should be separated from estimation window for not affect “the normality” of
estimation parameters.

The time line for a typical event study can be shown as followed:
                                         63




Where:

   o     -       is the estimation window used for estimating benchmark
       parameters, such as average return and benchmark standard deviation in
       case without the event. For being considered as benchmark, this window
       should be relatively far from the event. In our research, estimated window
       (T - T ) is the period from day -65 to day -16. We call this window is pure
       window during which there is no new information be made available to the
       market.
   o T - T is the event window, the period over which the event occurs;
   o T - T is the post-event window used for analyzing the influence of the
       event. This window can be combined with event window to be (T - T ). In
       this research, the Event window (T - T ) is the period from day -15 to day
       +14.

Step 5: Testing procedure

When the abnormal return is calculated, the estimation procedure will be formed
to verify the statistical significance of this abnormal return.

  The hypotheses are:

                                                 :       =0

                                                 :      ≠0

T statistics is used to examine the significance level and calculate as:

                                   AAR t
                            t                                             (3.18)
                                 S ( AAR )

In this research, AARt are the average abnormal returns of day t (t = 1, 15) with
day 0 is the XR day or announcement day.
                                            64




S(AAR) is the standard deviation of average abnormal returns and calculated as:

                                                ∑
                                   ∑                         −
                         (    )=
                                                    50 − 1
                                                                                (3.19)
Where
                                                ∑
                                       ∑
                                                     50
                                   =
                                                                                (3.20)
     is the average abnormal return run from day - 65 to day -16 of all companies
in our data. This period is not identical to the event period so that the results will
not be biased

Step 6: Empirical results

The presentation of the empirical results follows the formulation of the
econometric design.

Step 7: Result interpretation and conclusions

Identify mechanism of the effect of the event on stock price.

3.2.2.2 Determinants of market reaction to company’s SEOs:
We    examine      the   cross-section     of    market      reaction   company’s   SEOs
announcement. Regressing our panel data on Random effects and Fixed effects
model. The results generated by those two techniques will be compared by
Hausman test for selecting the most suitable technique.
In this research, the dependent variables are the cumulative abnormal returns
from day 0 to day +2, where day 0 is the event day:
            Cumulative abnormal returns from day 0 to day +2, where day 0 is
                the announcement day :
                                        65




            Cumulative abnormal returns from day 0 to day +2,where day 0 is
              the ex-right day:
The independent variables are as follow:
           To calculate the impact of Growth opportunity on market reaction,
              we used the ratio of TobinQ
           In order to find the effect of Market timing on market reaction, we
              used cumulative abnormal returns of market (MRUNUP);
           Besides the proxies for the main standard theories, we include D/A,
              ISSUESIZE, FIRMSIZE, INDUSTRY, ISSUEMETHOD and RMH as
              controlling variables.


D/A: According to DeAngelo and Masulis (1980); Masulis (1983) debt issuance
can be considered good news to market, seasoned equity announcement will lead
to decrease in stock price because of the reduction of the ratio of total
liabilities/total equity. However, new debt issuance can increase risk of company
because higher level of debt can lead to higher distress cost, to say nothing of the
possibility that creditors have to bear loss resulting from bad investment.
Research of Kang (1990) and Dhatt et. al. (1996) on Korean market finds positive
returns on announcement day of right distribution. They show that a reduction in
the ratio of debt/shareholder equity capital can reduce the possibility of financial
distress cost generating from high level of debt. However, research of Tan et. al.
(2002) finds no significant proof to support the theory of financial distress
reduction or wealth transfers from shareholders and creditors when company
issues its seasoned equity.

Tsangarakis (1996) use dummy variable as it is equal to 1 when company is listed
in the group with higher ratio of debt/total assets in comparison to others in the
sample and is equal to 0 otherwise. The author claims that the former is more
                                         66




likely to be bankrupt, or to put it another way, when company conducts SEOs, the
negative effect of wealth transfers from shareholders to creditors become more
serious than the latter; therefore, it will cause stock price decrease in
announcement period. However, the final finding shows no significant
differences. Research of Chikolwa and Kim (2009) at Australian stock market
shows that ratio of debt/total assets has positive correlation with stock returns in
the period of SEOs announcement and this result is relevant to the finding of
Masulis and Korwar (1986), Aggarwal et. al. (2008) at U.S stock market.

A reduction in the ratio of debt/equity will reduce the possibility of financial
distress occurrence which derived from high level of debt; therefore, stock price
will react positively when SEO announcement is publicized. Follow Masulis and
Korwar (1986), Tsangarakis (1996), Aggarwal and Zhao (2008), Chikolwa and
Kim (2009) we apply ratio of Total debts/Total assets (D/A) and expect this proxy
has negative sign with market’s reaction on event day.



ISSUE SIZE: Equity issuance will increase the number of stock on the market
and thus create the pressure on the stock price. Asquith and Mullins (1986),
Loderer and Zimmermann (1988) find that the larger size of the issuance will lead
to greater stock price reduction, to say nothing of the possibility of stock dilution
when outside investors will have opportunity to buy company stocks. Issuance
size is main proxy for price pressure on company stock price when company
issue SEOs and have been widely used in SEOs research such as Masulis and
Korwar (1986), Dhatt (1996), Salamudin et. al. (1999), Karbin and Roosenboom
(2002), Chikolwa and Kim (2009). Dhatt (1996) study at Korean market, in
contrast assumes that the ratio of number of issue equity/the outstanding number
of equity before the issuance has positive correlation with stock returns in
                                        67




announcement period. His explanation is that in case issuance conveys positive
information about company prospective future, the large issuance size with high
issuance cost signals confidence of managers about company future; therefore,
the larger the issuance size is, the better the market react to the issuance.
However, Aggarwal et. al. (2008), Chikolwa and Kim (2009) show that
increasing pressure on company stock price will lead to negative reaction of the
market when company announce SEOs.
Follow Masulis and Korwar (1986), Dhatt (1996), Salamudin et. al. (1999) and
Chikolwa and Kim (2009) we use Issue size (ISSUE SIZE) as proxy for the price
pressure on stock price. This proxy is expected to have negative sign to market
reaction because SEOs can increase the possibility of company stock dilution.


FIRM SIZE: Follow Owen and Suchard (2008), Chikolwa and Kim (2009) the
firm size (SIZE) measured by logarithm of company total assets is used. We
expect this variable to have positive correlation with market reaction since the
bigger the company is, the more closely it is followed by the market, therefore the
degree of information asymmetry in company will be reduced.



INDUSTRY: Owen and Suchard (2008), Chikolwa and Kim (2009), Bo (2011),
Fu et. al. (2012) show that industry plays important role in stock fluctuation in
announcement period. Their explanation is that each industry will lead to
different reaction of market toward company’s SEOs information conveyance.



ISSUANCE       METHOD:       Cahit   (2006)   examines    market’s    reaction   to
announcement of “unsweetened” (plain) and “sweetened” (with simultaneous
distribution of bonus issues) rights offerings in the Istanbul Stock Exchange and
                                        68




motivations and characteristics of companies using these two methods. His results
show that “unsweetened” method conveys negative information about company
future activities such as policy on investment, dividend and liquidity; on the other
hand, companies using “sweetened” method bring positive information such as
company achievement, cash flow and investment activities to the market.
Marisetty et. al. (2008) study at Indian stock market show an increase of stock
returns on announcement day because investors believe that right distribution will
increase company liquidity. On contrast, research at Chinese stock market of
Chen et al. (2007), Shahid (2010) and Thailand stock exchange of Leskullawat
(2011) witness a decrease in stock price.



RMH: Jensen and Meckling (1976) assume that company value increase with the
extent of managerial ownership structure. In the model of ownership structure and
signaling of Leland and Pyle (1977), Grinblatt and Hwang (1989), the number of
equity hold by managers signals for assets value of company. Conducting SEOs
reduces ownership of managers, which could lead to negative market’s reaction to
company SEOs issuance.

Agency problem claims that companies with higher managerial ownership
experience lower managerial discretion because managers suffer more monetary
consequences when they follow their own purposes. Obtaining the data on
ownership structure from Value Line for I00 equity issuing firms, Jung et. al.
(1996) find that low-ownership companies experience less abnormal return than
high-ownership companies.

A research of Owen and Suchard (2008) at Australian market measures
managerial ownership structure as percentage of equity hold by managers at the
end of year before announcement day, however their results show no significant
                                       69




effect of this ratio on stock returns in announcement period. A research at
Singapore stock market of Tan et. al. (2002) measures ownership structure
concentration as difference between the number of equity hold by big investor
who own more than 5% of company equity before and after the SEOs also finds
no significant differences between those two groups.

We use the ratio of managerial holding include the board of directors, board of
supervisor, president and CEO (Ratio of Managerial Holding - RMH) to proxy for
agency problem and expect this proxy has negative sign with market’s reaction to
SEOs.

Panel A shows the distribution of 482 SEOs over the sample period. Over time,
the number of SEOs fluctuated from 58 to 96 cases where 2007 and 2010
witnessed the largest number of SEOs companies (the percentage of companies
SEOs companies in 2007 and 2010 are 18.88% and 19.92%, respectively) while
in other years, the average number of SEOs cases is around 59 (about 12.3%).

Panel B displays sample distribution by issuance method. Approximately 65% of
the filings occur in the case of companies issued their SEOs as equity bonuses or
dividends which outweighed the cases of equity rights. The issuance method
which investors have to pay money to own companies’ shares through equity
rights seem to be less attractive to companies when issue SEOs. For achieving the
success of the issuance, offering “free shares” might be seen as a better option.

Panel C provides information about sample distribution by market capitalization.
The bigger the market capitalization the company is, the less likely it is to
conduct SEOs. Only 37.14% of SEOs cases are conducted by companies with big
and medium market capitalization (13.69% and 23.44%, respectively), while that
number of small market capitalization companies is 62.86%.
                                        73




Panel D presents sample distribution by industry. Approximately 44% of the
filings occur in the Manufacturing sector with less concentration in other
industries.

4.1.2 SEOs probability description:

Table 4.2 shows that during the period 2007-2013, among 1014 observations,
there were 482 observations conducted SEOs which is accounted for 47.53% of
total cases while the number of cases that did not conduct SEOs was 532
(52.47%). The difference between these two cases is not significant, which makes
us believe that SEOs has become a popular method for Vietnamese companies to
manage their finance and investment activities.

Table 4.3 displays SEOs companies and non-SEOs companies characteristics. We
observe that there is a positive relation between SEO cases and company leverage
ratio in comparison to average industry’s leverage ratio (DILR). The mean of
Difference between company’s leverage ratio and average of industry’s leverage
ratio for SEOs cases is 0.281, while that of non-SEOs cases is 0.226, suggesting
firstly evidence that company’s SEOs might be motivated by trade-off theory.
Our results show that the availability of growth opportunities (TobinQ) is also
correlated with the probability that company issue SEOs, on average TobinQ for
                                        74




SEOs cases is 1.760 while that of non-SEOs cases is 1.101. As far as the market
condition is concerned, we see that on average SEOs cases experience higher
market to book ratio (MB) than non-SEOs cases. This might be a result of market
timing since successful timing the market will lead to better issuance. The mean
of ratio of managerial holding/total outstanding shares (RMH) for SEOs cases is
19.66, while that of non-SEOs cases is 20.03, which is not significantly different.
From that result, we can conclude that controlling shareholders expropriation on
minor shareholders does not motivate SEOs determination.

We also observe from the table 4.3 that size of company (Size) which is measured
by logarithm of total assets and the ratio of total debt/total assets (D/A) of SEOs
group and non-SEOs group are almost identical. This result shows that the size of
company does not play significant role in manager’s SEOs motivation.
Companies with higher ratio of D/A tend to conduct SEOs as a tool to reduce its
debts. In comparison to non-SEOs cases, SEOs cases also experience higher
profitability (Profitability). The mean of EBIT/Total assets ratio for SEOs cases is
0.113, while that of non-SEOs cases is 0.086, suggesting that company with
higher profitability might be more confident about the success of the issuance.

We also include stock cumulative returns in the period runs from day -65 to day -
16 where day 0 is the announcement day (Runup) as another measurement for
market condition before announcement day. Our result shows significant
differences between these two groups. Before announcement day, the cumulative
returns of SEOs cases is 3.7%, which outweighs that of group of non-SEOs cases
(-9.3%), suggesting that company do time that market before its issuance.

In table 4.4, we describe SEOs characteristics by issuance method between
companies conduct their SEOs by equity right (right cases hereafter) and equity
bonuses or dividends (bonus cases hereafter). We expect that each different
purpose in financial activity will lead to different choice of company in choosing
relevant issuance method. In comparison to equity bonuses or dividends, SEOs by
equity rights can help company to raise more external capital to finance for its
activities. We observe that right cases are associated with higher leverage ratio in
comparison to average industry’s leverage ratio. The mean of Difference between
company’s leverage ratio and average of industry’s leverage ratio (DILR) for
right cases is 0.311, while that of bonuses cases is 0.265, providing initial
evidence that as to reduce the difference between its leverage ratio and industry’s
leverage ratio, company prefers equity rights to equity bonuses or dividends as
method to issue its SEOs. It appears that the availability of growth opportunities
(TobinQ) of right cases is also higher as compared to bonuses cases, the mean of
TobinQ for right cases is 1.760 while that of bonuses cases is 1.574, indicating
that motivation for choosing SEOs issuance method might be affected by the
existence of company growth opportunities.
                                          77




The mean of market to book ratio (MB) for right cases is 2.876, while that of
bonuses cases is 2.473, suggesting that choosing SEOs issuance method may be
motivated by condition of the market. In case the market condition is more
favorable, company will choose equity rights as a means to raise its external
capital since the success of the this issuance might be more guaranteed. As far as
the ratio of managerial holdings (RMH) is concerned, we see that right cases have
higher ratio of managerial holdings as compared to bonuses cases. The mean of
RMH for right cases is 20.396, while that of bonus cases is 19.253, providing the
initial evidence that managerial holdings in a company might affect company’s
decision on SEOs issuance method.

Although the total assets (Size) appears to be higher for bonuses cases, difference
between two groups in total assets is not significant. On average, the logarithm of
total assets of right cases is 17.627, while that of bonuses cases is 17.756. We
also observe from table 4.4 that the mean of total debt/total assets ratio (D/A) of
right cases is 0.572, which is higher than that of bonuses cases (0.504). It appears
that the profitability (Profitability) of bonuses cases is higher than right cases, the
mean of profitability of bonuses cases and right cases are 0.120 and 0.100,
respectively. The observation on size, ratio of total debt/total assets and
profitability of company provide us with initial evidences that those three factors
do not play significant roles in company decision making on choosing issuance
method.

4.2 Determinants of company’s SEOs motivation:

To examine the determinants of company’s SEOs decisions, we apply a panel
data using both probit and logit model in Stata; however the results are almost
identical between those two methods. Therefore, in this session, we only present
the results obtained by probit model.

We first check whether SEOs related theories proxies can predict company SEOs
determination. Our results are shown in table 4.5 and table 4.6. Each column in
table 4.5 and table 4.6 except for the last column represented each theory that
explaining SEOs motivation. Concerning about the correlation between
mentioned theories that could lead to simultaneous effects, we therefore integrate
all mentioned theories into one equation in the final column of table 4.5 and 4.6.
due to the concern that the proxies for different theories may be correlated with
each other and hence carry the effect of other theories.

We interpret the coefficients of determination (R-squared) which give an overall
idea of the models goodness. Our results show fluctuation from 15.81% to
30.12% where R2 of the full model (column 5) equals 30.12% with all the p-value
equals 0.000 (1% inferior). We assume that, in general the explanatory variables
can interpret motivation of company’s SEOs. After interpreting general model
significance, we then study the explanatory variables significance and their signs.

Model estimation results shown that TobinQ; ratio of Market value/Book value
(MB); Firm size (Size); ratio of Total debt/Total asset (DA) and Profitability are
significant at the 5% and 1% level while only ratio of managerial holding (RMH)
is insignificant. In comparison to companies that do not issue SEOs, companies
with higher TobinQ ratio, higher ratio of Market value/Book value, higher ratio of
total debt/total assets and higher profitability are more likely to issue SEOs. On
contrary, companies with higher ratio of leverage relative to industry’s average
leverage and larger in size are less likely to issue SEOs.

As we can see from Table 4.5, the estimated coefficient for the proxy of the trade-
off theory (DILR) have negative sign and are insignificant in both column (1) and
(5), implying that companies are not motivated to use SEOs as a means to adjust
their capital structure. This result has rejected our hypothesis 1 that the difference
between company’s leverage ratio and average of industry’s leverage ratio
(DILR) has positive impact on company’s SEOs decision. Therefore, we can
confirm that Trade-off theory does not impact on company’s decision on issuing
SEOs.

Both column (2) and (5) of table 4.5 show significantly positive signs of
estimated coefficients for TobinQ, which imply that companies tend to issue
SEOs when they have more growth opportunities, which is consistent with the
growth opportunity theory. Table 4.6 presents that companies with higher TobinQ
are 4% more likely to conduct SEOs than companies with lower TobinQ, this
result is relevant to our expectation since companies with more investment
opportunities will be motivated to conduct SEOs to finance for their
opportunities. Our finding is also consistent to results of Chikolwa and Kim
(2009), Duca (2011); therefore, the hypothesis 2 companies with higher TobinQ
ratio are more likely to issue SEOs is accepted. From this result, we can conclude
                                         81




that growth opportunities theory influences company’s SEOs decision remains
unchanged (no rejection).

In column (3) and (5) of table 4.5 the estimated coefficients for the ratio of
market value/book value (MB) which is proxy for market timing theory is
significant with positive sign, which suggests that choosing time is one of
motivations of companies to issues SEOs. Our result in table 4.6 shows that
companies experience higher ratio of market value/book value are 12.4% more
likely to conduct SEOs than the rest. This result is relevant to our expectation that
companies will choose time when market overvalues their stocks to issue
seasoned equity. From the results above we can conclude that the hypothesis 3
companies with higher ratio of M/B are more likely to conduct SEOs is not
rejected (hypothesis no rejected). We can also confirm that the market timing
theory impacts company’s SEOs decision.

The estimated coefficients for ratio of managerial holding /total outstanding
shares (RMH) has a negative sign and is insignificant in both column (4) and (5)
of table 4.5, suggesting that company’s SEOs decision is not motivated as a tool
for controlling shareholders to expropriate minority shareholders, which is
inconsistent with the agency problem theory. This result is inconsistent with our
hypothesis 4 that the ratio of managerial holding (RMH) positively affects
company’s SEOs decisions. From this result, we conclude that the Agency
problem theory does not play important role on company’s SEOs decision.

Besides the results regarding to proxies for SEOs motivation explaining theories,
all of our controlling variables show significance results. We find that firm size
estimated coefficients (Size) are significant with negative sign in all estimations,
implying that small companies are more likely to conduct SEOs. Our result in
table 4.6 shows that small companies are 4% more likely to conduct SEOs than
                                         82




large companies, we expect this result is explained by the fact that small
companies with limited access to bank loan will try to increase their financial
resources through SEOs instead of borrowing from the banks which also offer
relatively high interest rate during research period.

Secondly, the relation between the ratio of total debts/total assets and SEOs
motivation is highly significant with positive sign in all estimations. Our result
shows that companies with higher ratio of total debts/total assets are nearly 88%
more likely to conduct SEOs in comparison to those that have lower ratio of
debt/total assets (Table 4.6). This indicates that companies with higher ratio of
debt are more motivated to issue SEOs as means to reduce their level of debt. The
interest rate for business loan during research period (2007 - 2013) is high since
Vietnamese government í making effort to control the inflation. Companies with
more debts, therefore, will use SEOs to increase their funds instead of borrowing
more debts.

Thirdly, all the estimated coefficients for profitability are significantly positive,
which is not consistent with pecking order theory prediction. This theory claims
that company profitability has negative correlation with SEOs decision because
the more profitable the company is, the higher internal resources company has;
therefore, it does not have to excess external resources such as loans borrowing or
issuing SEOs. However, within the case of Vietnamese companies, to guarantee
the attraction and the success of the issuance, companies with more profitability
will be more self-motivated to issue SEOs to attract the investors to the bright
scenario future of companies. The result in table 4.6 shows that companies with
higher profitability are 72% more likely to conduct SEOs in comparison to those
that have less profitability.

4.3 Determinants of company’s SEOs motivation by issuance method:

Issuing SEOs by equity rights (rights hereafter) can help company raise more
external financial resources while issuing SEOs by equity bonuses or dividends
(bonuses hereafter) help company reallocate the structure of its internal financial
resources. Each issuance method will be motivated by different characteristics
and motivation of company that lead to different reactions from the market. In
this section, we try to explain motivation of companies using those two types of
SEOs. We first test if the SEOs theories proxies can be used to estimate the
likelihood that companies issue SEOs by equity rights and by equity bonuses or
dividends (table 4.7 and table 4.8). Finally, we examine the motivation that
company conduct SEOs by equity rights instead of by equity bonuses or
dividends.

The results are reported in table 4.7 and table 4.8. Each column in table 4.7 and
table 4.8 except the last column represented each theory explaining the
motivation of SEOs by two types of issuance. Concerning about the correlation
between mentioned theories that could lead to simultaneous effects, we therefore
integrate all mentioned theories into one equation in the final column of table 4.7
and table 4.8.

The goodness of the models (R-squared) fluctuates from 12.91% to 40.61%
where R2 of the full model (column 5) equals 40.61% (rights) and 25.74%
(bonuses) with all the p-value is equal to 0.000 (1% inferior). We assume that in
general explanatory variables can present motivation of company SEOs by these
two methods.

The estimation results of the model reveal that Difference between company’s
leverage ratio and average of industry’s leverage ratio (DILR); Firm size (Size)
                                        86




are significant with negative sign; while TobinQ; ratio of Market value/Book
value (MB); ratio of Total debt/Total asset (DA) and Profitability are significant
with positive signs. On contrary, only ratio of managerial holding (RMH) is
insignificant in all models.

As we can see from Table 4.7, the estimated coefficient for the proxy of the trade-
off theory (DILR) has a negative sign and is significant in all columns, suggesting
that the trade-off theory has impact on the probability that company issues its
SEOs. However, the magnitude impacts of trade-off theory on type of method
that company chose to conduct its SEOs are different. Table 4.8 shows that
companies with lower ratio of leverage relative to industry’s average leverage are
11.5% more likely to conduct SEOs by equity bonuses or dividends while only
7.9% possibility that company will choose to issue SEOs by equity rights. We can
conclude that the lower the ratio of leverage relative to industry’s average
leverage the company is, the more likely it is to choose equity bonuses or
dividends as method to issue SEOs.

The estimated coefficient for TobinQ, which is proxy for Growth opportunity
theory is highly significant with a positive sign in all models. Table 4.8 presents
that companies with higher TobinQ are 2.8% more likely to conduct SEOs by
equity bonuses or dividends while they will be 6.9% more likely to conduct SEOs
by equity rights, implying that companies are more likely to issue SEOs by equity
rights when they have more growth opportunities.

In all columns of table 4.7 the estimated coefficient for the ratio of market
value/book value (MB) which is proxy for market timing theory is significant
with positive sign. Our result in table 4.8 shows that companies experience higher
ratio of market value/book value are 11.8% more likely to conduct SEOs by
equity bonuses or dividends while they are only 7.7% more likely to use equity
                                         87




rights, suggesting that the more favorable the market condition is, the more likely
company will chose equity bonuses or dividends to issue SEOs.

The estimated coefficient for ratio of managerial holding /total outstanding shares
(RMH) has a negative sign and is insignificant in all column, suggesting that
SEOs decision is not motivated by agency problem theory.

Regarding to our controlling variables, our results show that despite the size of
company (Size) and ratio of total debts to total assets (DA) are significant in all
columns; they do not show remarkable difference on two methods. However in
case of profitability, companies with more profitability are nearly 84% more
likely to choose equity bonuses or dividends as way to conduct their SEOs, while
they are only 30.2% more likely to use equity rights. We believe that companies
with more growth opportunities will need more external funds to make enough
financial resources to finance for those projects.

4.4 Conclusion:

Chapter 4 discuss the integration of SEO motivations explaining theories into
Vietnamese stock market by examining company’s SEOs motivation. There is a
demand of SEO discussion in Vietnam due to the literature shortage on this topic.
Our results show that companies have more growth opportunities, experience
favorable market timing, smaller in size, have higher ratio of total debts/total
assets and are more profitable are more likely to issue SEOs. These results
support evidence of the impact of growth opportunities theory, market timing
theory on company’s SEOs motivation in Vietnamese stock market.

We find that companies with lower ratio of leverage relative to industry’s average
leverage, have less growth opportunities, experience higher ratio of market
value/book value and have more profitability are more likely to issue SEOs by
equity bonuses or dividends.

                   MARKET REACTION TO COMPANY’S SEOs

5.1 Data description:

In table 5.1, we examine average abnormal returns (AAR), cumulative average
abnormal returns from event day to two days after that (CAR), the risk of
companies before event day (STD). The results show that AAR of ex-right day is
two times higher than that of announcement day; however, there are no
remarkable differences between CAR and STD of SEOs companies and non-
SEOs companies. We conclude that around event days, market reacts positively
to company’s SEOs.

Table 5.1 Characteristics of SEOs companies around event day data
description:
Characteristics of SEOs companies around announcement day and around the Ex-right day. The sample
period is from 2007 to 2013. AAR is average abnormal returns on event day; CAR is cumulative abnormal
returns in the period [0;+2] with day 0 is event day; STD denotes Standard deviation of stock returns in
the period runs from day -65 to day -16, where day 0 is the event day.

5.2 Market reaction to company’s SEOs:
5.2.1 Market reaction around announcement day:

Table 5.2 shows the positive reaction of the market to company’s SEOs. Prices
experience consecutive increase from day -11 to day +2. The most remarkable
increases are observed at the period of [-7;0] and [-2;+2]. The cumulative average
abnormal return in the period preceding announcement day increase steadily and
significantly, especially seven days before the announcement day, price increases
by 2.7% and are confirmed by statistic test at the significance level of 1%. In the
period of two days before and two days after the announcement day, the
cumulative average abnormal returns also increase by 2.8% and are testified by
the significance of 1 %.

In contrast to the decrease of price in the period of 14 days after ex-right day,
after announcement day, price only fall dramatically in three days (day +4; day
+10 and day +12), where day +4 witness the most dramatic decrease, then
followed by consecutive increase from day +5 to day +9, where day +6, and +7
experience significant increase. Within the period of 15 trading days after
announcement day, although the cumulative average abnormal returns still
increase but this increasing trend does not prolong, CAR [   ;   ]   = 2.0% decrease to
about 0.3% in the period of [+3;+14].
                                           94




In five consecutive days, from day +5 to day +9, price increase continuously,
CAR[+5;+9] = 1.04% and this consecutive increase is confirmed by statistic test
at the significance level of 1% This period has correlation with the distance
between announcement day and ex-right day, where the gap between those days
is usually from 5 to 9 days (Figure 5.1)

The AAR on announcement day recorded positive return with significance level
at 1%. The ratio of number of AAR increased/AAR decreased also confirm this
positive trend. This result is consistent with finding of Dhatt (1996) in Korean
stock market where the high volume of the SEOs will reduce the level of liability
in a company then reduce the cost of financial distress leading to positive
reactions from investors. Tsangarakis (1996) study at Athens Stock Exchange
also witnessed the same results. The author finds that SEOs increase the financial
resources in company, increase the ownership of big investors then reduce the
agency cost; Tan el. al. (2002) show that in Singapore capital market, company
issue SEOs after a period of stock price increasing; there is a trend of information
leaked before the announcement day that enable speculators to achieve high
returns.

Research on emerging market such as Malaysia stock market of Salamudin et. al.
(1999) find that investors expect that money from the issuance would be used to
finance profitable projects in potential high growth rate developing countries.
Marisetty et. al. (2008) study at Indian stock market suggest that the reasons for
stock price increase on announcement day is SEOs conducted under right
distributions will increase cash and financial liquidity in company.

Table 5.3 compares the differences of market reaction around announcement day
when the market condition is favorable and unfavorable.

When the market is favorable, stock price increases continuously from day -15 to
day -1 where period from day -8 to day -1 witness remarkable increase, CAR
during this period is about 4.4% while it is only about -0.2% when market
condition is unfavorable.

On announcement day, AAR when market condition is favorable is 0.9%, which
is three times higher than AAR when market is worse (0.3%). However, in the
period of announcement day and two days after that, the results are not different
                                              97




      remarkably. CAR[0;+2] is 2.2% and 1.8% when market condition is favorable
      and unfavorable, respectively. During this period, stock prices increase
      significantly and are supported by the number of AAR increase/ number of AAR
      decrease.

      In the observed window [-15;+14] the cumulative return when the market is
      favorable recorded at 7.5% which is more than 6 times higher than that when
      market is unfavorable (1.2%). This results show that market reacts positively
      when market is at good condition, investors tend to pay more attention to
      company’s SEOs.

     In table 5.4, we divide our sample into groups based on 3 criteria: market
     capitalization, Issuance method and Industry to examine whether market will
     react differently. Our results show no significant difference in market reaction
                                            99




between company market capitalization and industry, however, market reacts
differently when company conducts its SEOs by equity rights or equity
bonuses/dividends.

In the period [-8;-1] before announcement day both issuance method generate
positive returns with 2.1% and 2.3% when companies issue their SEOs as right
distribution   and     equity   bonuses/dividends,      respectively.   However,   on
announcement     day     and    two   day    after   that,   AAR of     SEOs   equity
bonuses/dividends companies are about 3 times higher than those of companies
using rights distribution, CAR[0;+2] of right distribution is about 0.9% while that
of equity bonuses/dividends is 2.6%. Our findings show that on announcement
day, market tends to favor SEOs by equity bonuses/dividends, there is a trend of
stock purchasing on that day.

On contrary, in the period of [+3;+14] the trend seems reverse. The cumulative
returns of companies using right distribution are 1.5% while that of companies
using equity bonuses/dividends is -0.3%. These results lead us to the conclusion
that, after a period of market positive reaction, investors start to adjust their
behavior by selling stocks that already generated high returns.

In observed window [-15;+14], on average, the cumulative returns of companies
conduct their SEOs as right distribution and equity bonuses/dividends are almost
identical. CAR[-15;+14] of right distribution companies is 4.8% while that of
companies using equity bonuses/dividends is 4.6%.

5.2.2 Market reaction around ex-right day:
Table 5.5 shows that the stock prices increase significantly on ex-right day and
one day later (day +1) with an increase of 1.2% and 0.6% respectively with the
significance at 1%. Examining the number of stocks increased/the number of
stocks decreased on these two days, we find that the number of stock increased
outweigh the number of stock decreased 333/182 (on day 0) and 290/225 (on day
+1). The cumulative returns in the period [0; +1] and [0, +2] also record
significant increase by 1.8% and 2% respectively.

In the period of ten days before the ex-right day, market react positively to
companies’ SEOs, the stock prices experience continuous increase from day -15
to day -4 and most of them are at significance level of 1%. The cumulative
abnormal return of the market in the period [-15; -4] is recorded at 3.8% which is
totally different to that of the period [-3;-1] where day 0 is ex-right day, the price
start to decline (the most significant decreases are at day -3 and day -2, the total
decrease is about -0.8% with the significance level at 1%.

In contrast to period after announcement day, after ex-right day, the price decline
continuously from day +3 to day +14. The cumulative returns in the period
[+3;+7] is -0.9% and [+3;+14] is more than -1%, both results are significant at
1%. We imply that after a period of prices increasing, seasoned equities become
less attractive to investors, especially after the ex-right day.

Table 5.6 compares the market reaction around XR day in favorable and
unfavorable time. When the market is favorable, AAR witness continuous
increase from day -15 to day -5 with the cumulative increase reaches 5.4%. This
increasing trend is also supported by the number of AR increase/ number of AR
decrease. While in unfavorable time, AAR just start to increase from day -9 to
day -4 with the cumulative abnormal returns is about 2%. These findings support
our believe that there is a trend of speculation before ex-right day, especially
when the market is favorable.
                                       105




In the period of one to three day before XR day, in both market conditions, stock
price starts to decline significantly and is supported by the number of AR
increase/number of AR decrease. In favorable time, the cumulative decrease is
about -1% while that in unfavorable timing is -0.8%. On contrary, from XR day
to 2 day after that, stock price rise remarkably in both market timing. When
market is favorable and unfavorable, AAR on XR day is 1.5% and 0.8%,
CAR[0;+2] is 2.5% and 1.2% respectively.

Three to seven day after XR day, stock price decline significantly when market is
favorable, the cumulative decrease is about -1.1% and is supported by the number
of AR increase/number of AR decrease while in unfavorable time, this reduction
trend is only about -0.5%. Our finding shows that after a period of increasing
especially when market timing is favorable, stock price starts to decline, the
larger the magnitude of price increasing before XR day, the larger the magnitude
of price decreasing after XR day.

In the period of 30 day from day [-15;+14] the cumulative return when market is
favorable is 5.6% which is 3 times higher than that when market is unfavorable
(which is only 1.7%). This result confirms our believe that when market is
favorable, the market reacts more positively.

In table 5.7, we divide our data into groups based on 3 criteria: market
capitalization, Issuance method and Industry to observe the market reaction
around XR day. Our results show no significant difference between company
market capitalization and industry; however, market reacts differently when
company conducts its SEOs by equity rights or equity bonuses/dividends.

In the period [-15;-5] before ex-right day, cumulative stock returns of companies
conduct their SEOs by equity bonuses/dividends are 4.3% which outweigh that of
companies conduct their SEOs by right distribution (which is only 2.5%).
However, in the next three day, stock price start to decline, the cumulative decline
in the period [-3;-1] are -1.6% in case companies offer their SEOs by right
distributions and -0.5% with the remaining companies. This result shows that
before XR day, market seem favor SEOs by equity bonuses/dividends than by
equity rights.
                                      108




On XR day, companies conduct SEOs as right distribution witness increase at
1.6% and the cumulative increase in the period [0;+2] is recorded at 3.1% while
that of companies using equity bonuses/dividends are only 0.9% on XR day and
1.1% in the same observed period. In the period [+3;+14] the cumulative returns
of companies conduct SEO as equity rights and equity bonuses/dividends are -
0.5% and -1.5% respectively. Our findings show that market tends to favor SEOs
that are conducted as equity bonuses/dividends before XR day but this trend will
soon be reversed. And the fact is that SEOs cases that require investors to pay
money to own will gain more returns than the “free ones”.

We have investigated the market reaction in terms of stock price fluctuation
around announcement day and ex-right day using all data sample and divided by
criteria. All the results show that SEOs announcements have impact on market’s
reaction (there are abnormal returns on event days: AAR ≠ 0) which lead us to
reject our hypothesis 5 that SEOs announcement do not have impact on market’s
reaction (there are no abnormal returns on event days: AAR = 0). This result
confirms that Ho Chi Minh stock exchange is not efficient in term of semi-strong
form.

                      Figure 5.1 Relation between AD and XR

Figure 5.1 shows the day distance between announcement day and ex-right day.
Company usually chose the ex-right day in the period of 5 to 9 days after the
announcement day, the number of companies choose ex-right day in this period
                                       112




accounted for 80.8% of all SEOs cases. Ex-right day usually occurs in the second
week after the announcement day, thus, this will affect AAR of that period.


5.4 Determinants of market reaction to company’s SEOs:
To examine the determinants of market reaction around SEOs announcement day
and ex-right day, we apply a panel data using both random effects and fixed
effects model in Stata, we then use Hausman test to select the most suitable
model and present the results obtained by that selected model. Based on this
result, we conduct the tests for heteroskedasticity, serial correlation and
multicollinearity.
We first check whether the proxies for SEOs theories affect determinants of
market reaction around event day. The results are reported in table 5.8 (in case of
announcement day) and table 5.9 (in case of ex-right day). Each column in these
two tables except for the last column is relevant to each theory explains
determinant of market reaction around event day. We integrate all mentioned
theories into one equation in the final column of table 5.8 and 5.9 to serve the
purpose of examining the correlation between mentioned theories that could lead
to simultaneous effects.
5.4.1 Determinants of market reaction around announcement day:

Table 5.8 displays the determinants of market reaction around announcement day.
The results from Hausman test show that random effects model is the appropriate
model (p-value > 0.05); therefore we will interpret the results and test for
heteroskedasticity, serial correlation and multicollinearity based on the random
effects model.

In the full model (column 3), the p-value is equal to 0.0002 which is 1% inferior,
we conclude that overall the explanatory variables in our model can explain the
                                        113




determinants of market reaction around announcement day. The estimated
coefficients show that Market runup (Mrunup), firm size (Firmsize), issuance
method (Issuemethod) are significant while other variables show no significant
statistics results.

The TobinQ which is proxy for growth opportunities theory shows no significant
result in both column (1) and (3), suggesting that investors are not influenced by
the growth opportunities of company. This result is irrelevant to our expectation
that TobinQ positively affects market reaction around announcement day.
However, in case of Vietnamese stock market, this result can be explained that
investor might not see information about growth opportunities advantageous
information when consider buying SEOs, or they are not fully aware of the
availability of company growth opportunities before announcement day. From
this result, we reject the hypothesis 6.a and conclude that growth opportunity
theory does not play important role on determinants of market reaction around
announcement day.

The estimated coefficients for the proxy of Market timing theory (Mrunup) has
positive sign and is significant in both column (2) and (3), suggesting that the
condition of the market before announcement day influences the market reaction.
Investors will base on the condition of the market from 2 to 3 months before
announcement day to make their decisions on whether to get involved in
company SEOs. This result is relevant to our initial expectation that the better the
market condition is, the better the market react to company SEOs. From the
results above we can conclude that the hypothesis H7a: Mrunup has positive
impact on market’s reaction on announcement day is not rejected (hypothesis no
rejected). Our result is consistent with the findings of of Salamudin et. al. (1999)
                                             114




at Malaysia stock market and Balachandran et. al. (2008) at London Stock
Exchange.

The estimated coefficient of equity rights has negative sign means that, on
average, this method generated 1.1% less returns than SEOs by equity bonuses or
dividends. The difference between those two methods is also testified at the
significance of 5%.

In the next steps, we will test for the heteroskedasticity, serial correlation and
multicollinearity.

5.4.2 Determinants of market reaction around ex-right day:

Table 5.9 presents the determinants of market reaction around ex-right day. The
results from Hausman test show that random effects model is the appropriate
model (p-value > 0.05); therefore we will interpret the results and test for
heteroskedasticity, serial correlation and multicollinearity based on the random
effects model.

In the full model (column 3), the p-value is equal to 0.0002 (inferior to 1%), we
conclude that overall the explanatory variables in our model can explain the
determinants of market reaction around ex-right day. The estimated coefficients
show that TobinQ, issue size (Issuesize), firm size (Firmsize), MAI (group of
companies listed in Manufacturing industry which includes mining, processing,
electricity production and distribution, natural gas, boiler, steamer and air
                                        118




conditioner) are significant while other variables show no significantly statistics
results.

The coefficient TobinQ which is proxy for growth opportunities in both column
(1) and (3) are significant with positive signs, suggesting that the information
about existence of company growth opportunities influence the market reaction.
This result is relevant to our expectation that TobinQ have positive relation with
company’s stock abnormal return since company with more investment
opportunities can attract more investors to buy it SEOs. We conclude that the
growth opportunities theory impact on market reaction around ex-right day;
therefore, the hypothesis 6b is accepted.
Market runup (Mrunup) which is proxy for market timing theory show no
significant result, implying that market condition before ex-right day does not
influence the reaction of the market, which is irrelevant to our expectation that
better the market condition is, the better the market reaction to company SEOs.
From this result, hypothesis 7b is rejected.
The issue size, which is stand for the price pressure on company stock price is
expected to have negative sign on event day because SEOs can increase the
possibility of company stock dilution. However, our result shows positive relation
between issue size and market reaction. This might be explained that in case of
Vietnamese stock exchange, larger issuance will increase market liquidity, which
leads to positive reaction.
The firm size is expected to have positive correlation with SEOs market reaction
however our result show contradicted sign. We think that, in case of Vietnamese
stock market, investors might believe that the larger the company is, the more
complicated it is, therefore the capital generated from the issuance may not be
used effectively. Our finding is consistent with the results of Bo et. al. (2011)
conducted at Chinese Stock market.
                                             119




Among the industries, only the company listed in Manufacturing industry group
which includes mining, processing, electricity production and distribution, natural
gas, boiler, steamer and air conditioner companies is significant with a negative
sign. Thus, we can conclude that Industry has an impact on market’s reaction
around XR day.

In the next steps, we will test for the heteroskedasticity, serial correlation and
multicollinearity.

Testing for heteroskedasticity:

       Breusch and Pagan Lagrangian multiplier for random effects
       Car(cty,t) = Xb + u[cty] + e[cty,t]
       Estimated results:

       Test: Var(u) = 0
       Chibar2(01) = 0.04
       Prob > chibar2 = 0.4186

       The p-value > 0.05 so we accept the Ho: there is no heteroskedasticity in
       our model.


Testing for serial correlation:

       Wooldridge test for autocorrelation in panel data
       H0: no first-order autocorrelation
                                           120




         F(1, 23) = 0.258
         Prob>F = 0.6163
         The p-value > 0.05 so we accept the Ho: there is no first-order
         autocorrelation in our model.


Testing for serial multicollinearity:

  Issue size        2.24             1.50          0.4473          0.5527
  Firm size         2.70             1.64          0.3705          0.6295

  Mean VIF          1.44

Because VIF < 10, we can conclude that there is no serial multicollinearity in our
model.

5.5 Conclusion:

In this chapter, we examine the market reaction and determinants of market
reaction to company’s SEOs. Applying the Event study method with
announcement day and ex-right day are two main events, our results show that in
general, market reacts positively to company’s SEOs around event day, especially
when the market condition is favorable.

HOSE is not efficient in semi-strong form, there is a trend of stock price increase
before announcement day, which is a sign of information leakage before the
announcement.

Market reacts positively in both period preceding and following announcement
day; however, in case of ex-right day, in the period of 3 day before ex-right day [-
                                        123



3;-1] and from 3 day after ex-right day [+3;+14], stock prices witness significant
decrease.

Before event day, market tends to prefer equity bonuses/dividends to equity
rights; however, this trend will reverse after event day since investors start to
adjust their behavior by selling stocks that already generate high returns.

Examining determinants of market reaction to company’s SEOs, our results show
that around announcement day, market condition significantly influences market
reaction to company’s SEOs, supporting the impact of market timing theory;
besides, the equity rights generate less returns than equity bonuses/dividends.
Around ex-right day, the information about existence of company growth
opportunities significantly affects the market reaction, implying the impact of
growth opportunities theory. Market seems to favor companies offer larger SEOs
size, smaller companies or companies listed in manufacturing industry.

                                   CHAPTER 6
                       CONCLUSION AND SUGGESTION

6.1 Conclusion:

When examining company’s SEOs motivation, we find that in comparison to
non-SEOs companies, companies with higher TobinQ ratio, higher ratio of
Market value/Book value, higher ratio of total debt/total assets and higher
profitability are more likely to issue SEOs. On contrary, companies with higher
ratio of leverage relative to industry’s average leverage and larger in size are less
likely to conduct SEOs.

When choosing issuance method, companies with lower ratio of leverage relative
to industry’s average leverage, higher profitability and companies experience
more favorable market condition are more likely to issue SEOs by equity bonuses
or dividends than by equity rights; on contrary, companies are more likely to
issue SEOs by equity rights when they have more growth opportunities

Examine on market reaction to company’s SEOs, our results show that Ho Chi
Minh stock market is not efficient in term of semi-strong form. Before the
announcement day, there is a trend of stock purchasing, which is a sign of
information leakage.

Around announcement day, price increase significantly in both before and after
that day; while after ex-right day, the increasing trend does not prolong.

The distance between the announcement day and the ex-right day is from 5 to 9
days, which affects the average abnormal returns of this period.

Before event day, market tends to favor companies conduct SEOs by equity
bonuses or dividends than by equity rights. However, investors will soon adjust
their behavior by selling those stocks which already generated high profit.
                                        125




In examining the determinants of market reaction to company’s SEOs around
announcement day, our results show no evidences to support the influences of
growth opportunities on market reaction around announcement day. However, in
case of Vietnamese stock market, this result can be explained that investor might
not see information about growth opportunities advantageous information when
they consider buying SEOs, or they are not fully aware of the availability of
company growth opportunities. Regarding to market timing theory, we find that
the condition of the market before announcement day influences the market
reaction. Investors will base on the condition of the market from 2 to 3 months
before announcement day to make their decisions on whether to get involved in
company SEOs. This result supports the influence of market timing theory on
determinants of market reaction to company’s SEOs. Besides, our result shows
that equity rights generated less returns than equity bonuses or dividends.

Regarding the determinants of market reaction to company’s SEOs, TobinQ
which is proxy for growth opportunities is significant with positive signs,
suggesting that the information about existence of company growth opportunities
influence the reaction of the market around ex-right day. We conclude that
growth opportunities theory impact on market reaction around ex-right day. The
market timing theory, on the other hand show no significant result, implying that
market condition before ex-right day does not influence the reaction of the
market. Besides, we find positive relation between issue size and market reaction.
This might be explained that in case of Vietnamese stock exchange, larger
issuance will increase market liquidity, which leads to positive reaction. Firm size
shows negative sign to market reaction around ex-right day. We think that, in
case of Vietnamese stock market, investors might believe that the larger the
company is, the more complicated it is, therefore the capital generated from the
issuance may not be used effectively.

6.2 Suggestion for stakeholders:

From the research findings, we then point out suggestions for relevant
stakeholders to support them in their finance and investment activities.

In case of investors:

An appropriate investment strategy on SEOs can bring certain benefit to
investors, our results recommend that investors could consider following factors:

The existences of growth opportunities, market condition, the magnitude of the
issuance, size of company and the type of issuance methods are factors that
influence company stock returns around event days.

Around the announcement day, companies experience favorable market
condition,    smaller    companies      and    companies      that   choose     equity
bonuses/dividends as their SEOs method generate more cumulative abnormal
returns than the remaining companies. On contrary, around ex-right day, investors
seem to favor companies with more growth opportunities, larger magnitude of
SEOs issued and smaller companies.

About 2 weeks before announcement day, investors might consider buying
company’s SEOs, especially choose SEOs by equity bonuses/dividends of
companies experience higher cumulative market returns, or from smaller
companies. In case investors has missed the announcement day, about 3 weeks
before the ex-right day, they could consider joining the issuance by purchasing
SEOs from companies with more growth opportunities, offer larger issue size.

To prepare necessary financial resources to buy companies SEOs, investors might
base on those characteristics of companies such as the TobinQ, ratio of Market
value/Book value, ratio of total debt/total assets, profitability and ratio of leverage
relative to industry’s average leverage to predict their SEOs announcement. Our
                                        127




results show that in comparison to companies that do not conduct SEO,
companies with higher TobinQ ratio, higher ratio of Market value/Book value,
higher ratio of total debt/total assets and higher profitability are more likely to
issue SEOs. On contrary, companies with higher ratio of leverage relative to
industry’s average leverage and larger in size are less likely to conduct SEOs.

In case investor prefers SEOs by equity bonuses or dividends, we suggest
investor should choose company with lower ratio of leverage relative to
industry’s average leverage company, company experiences favorable market
condition before announcement day and company with more profitability. On
contrary, companies are more likely to issue SEOs by equity rights when they
have more growth opportunities

In case of SEOs companies:

Ho Chi Minh stock market is not efficient in term of semi-strong form. Before the
announcement day, there is a trend of stock purchasing, which is a sign of
information leakage. The market is not efficient means that 1) the information is
not transparent; 2) there are information asymmetries among groups of investor
3) information is leaked before the official information are made available to
public. We suggest that SEOs companies should strengthen the information
dissemination activities by following regulations in information dissemination of
state securities commission of Vietnam in a serious, strict manner and closely
monitored the compliance with information dissemination regulations to
guarantee the transparency, fairness and effectiveness to deal with the situation of
unbalanced information and protect individual investors.

To ensure the success of SEOs issuance, company should choose appropriate
market timing as when the market is favorable, investors seem to care less about
                                       128




the fact that company equity is overvalued or the stock dilution they might
encounter when purchasing seasoned equities.

Investors seem to favor SEOs by equity bonuses or dividends which they do not
have to pay more to own company equity, conducting SEOs by this method might
be more appealing to investors; however, in case company wants to raise external
financial resources by conducting SEOs rights issuance, choosing market timing
is an optimal option company should consider.

Before the announcement day, company should promote the information
dissemination about company activities, especially the availability of growth
opportunities to draw investors’ attention to company SEOs.

The size of the issuance also affects SEOs investment strategy of investors. Our
results show that the issuances with bigger SEOs amount are more appealing to
investors than smaller ones, suggesting that investors might consider big issuance
a “good deal”.

                       AND FIXED EFFECT MODEL

1. Determinants of market reaction around SEO announcement day

Determinants of market reaction around announcement day: panel data Random effects, Fixed effects estimation. This table presents results of
regression on cumulative average abnormal return CAR[0;+2]. The sample period is from 2007 to 2013. The dependent variable is cumulative
abnormal return in the period [0;+2]. TobinQ is measured as (Market value of stock + Book value of debt)/Book value of total assets; Mrunup indicates
Market cumulative abnormal returns (VNIndex) in the period runs from day -65 to day -16, where day 0 is the announcement day; DA indicates Total
debt/Total asset; Issuesize denotes Logarithm of the volume of stock issued; Firmsize is Logarithm of total assets; Industry effect and issue method
effect are controlled by adding industry dummy (REC takes value 1 if SEOs issued company is listed in Real estate and construction group and takes
value 0 otherwise, MAI takes value 1 if SEOs issued company is listed in Manufacturing industry group and takes value 0 otherwise, SER takes value
1 if SEOs issued company is listed in Service group and takes value 0 otherwise, FBI takes value 1 if SEOs issued company is listed in Financial –
banking – Insurance services and takes value 0 otherwise, AFF takes value 1 if SEOs issued company is listed in Agriculture – Fishery – Forestry
group and takes value 0 otherwise); and issue method dummies; RMH indicates ratio of managerial holding include the board of directors, board of
supervisor, president and CEO/Total outstanding shares; t-statistics are in parentheses; *** Statistically significant at the 1% level; ** Statistically
significant at the 5% level; * Statistically significant at 10% level.

2. Determinants of market reaction around SEOs ex-right day:

Determinants of market reaction around ex-right day: panel data Random effects, Fixed effects estimation. This table presents results of regression on
cumulative average abnormal return on CAR[0;+2]. The sample period is from 2007 to 2013. The dependent variable is cumulative abnormal return in
the period [0;+2]. TobinQ is measured as (Market value of stock + Book value of debt)/Book value of total assets; Mrunup indicates Market
cumulative abnormal returns (VNIndex) in the period runs from day -65 to day -16, where day 0 is the announcement day; DA indicates Total
debt/Total asset; Issuesize denotes Logarithm of the volume of stock issued; Firmsize is Logarithm of total assets; Industry effect and issue method
effect are controlled by adding industry dummy (REC takes value 1 if SEOs issued company is listed in Real estate and construction group and takes
value 0 otherwise, MAI takes value 1 if SEOs issued company is listed in Manufacturing industry group and takes value 0 otherwise, SER takes value
1 if SEOs issued company is listed in Service group and takes value 0 otherwise, FBI takes value 1 if SEOs issued company is listed in Financial –
banking – Insurance services and takes value 0 otherwise, AFF takes value 1 if SEOs issued company is listed in Agriculture – Fishery – Forestry
group and takes value 0 otherwise); and issue method dummies; RMH indicates ratio of managerial holding include the board of directors, board of
supervisor, president and CEO/Total outstanding shares; t-statistics are in parentheses; *** Statistically significant at the 1% level; ** Statistically
significant at the 5% level; * Statistically significant at 10% level.
