                         CHAPTER 1:        INTRODUCTION
1.1.   Background
   Vietnam’s economic system has been significantly reformed with the goal of
building a socialist-oriented market economy since Doi Moi (Renovation) in 1986 and
the country has comprehensively integrated into the global economy since the early
1990s. Vietnam has become the member of regional and international trade
organizations and schemes such as ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), ASEAN
Economic Community (AEC), Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), World
Trade Organization (WTO), and Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP-CPTPP). The country
has signed bilateral trade agreements with countries and regions such as the United
States, Japan, Chile, Korea, Eurasian Economic Union (EEU), and European
Communities (EU). Vietnam is going to sign bilateral trade agreements with Israel and
EU Free Trade Agreement (EFTA). Especially, the future trade agreement of ASEAN +
6 will remarkably expand the free trade market and strongly enhance trades between the
countries to build up the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).
   The economic development, industrialization process, and transition of Vietnam
have been significantly supported and contributed by the agricultural sector. First,
agricultural export accounts for over 33 percent in 1997 and 17 percent in 2014 of the
total export value and contribute foreign exchange to import the essential technology,
machines,   materials,    and   other   equipment   for   economic    development     and
industrialization process. Second, the agricultural sector accounts for 26 percent in 1997
and 18.12 percent in 2014 of Vietnam’s gross domestic product. Third, Vietnam’s
agricultural sector accounts for more than 48 percent of total employment as the third
most dependent country on agricultural employment in the world, just after Bhutan and
Cambodia. Fourth, the sector is one of the key economic activities in the rural economy
and an important source of livelihood amongst rural population. There is about 67.1
percent of the country’s population living in rural areas in 2014 (GSO, 2017; WB,
                                           2



2017). Fifth, moreover, the agricultural sectors and rural areas can play the important
roles in both labor supply and demand markets.
   Though achieving advantage from the natural environment, fertile soil and abundant
water resource Vietnam’s agricultural sectors encounter the problems of domination of
small-scale farms, negative impact on the environment, cultivation land conversion
towards urbanization and industrialization, new challenges from climate changes,
increasing input costs, and low productivity. Vietnam’s agricultural sector is mainly
based on the traditional and land-intensive production methods. This makes the
agricultural sector to be dependent on the natural conditions and market situations and
may cause the farmers the unstable and low incomes. Moreover, the agricultural product
markets and prices of Vietnam are relatively unstable and fluctuating without the master
agricultural production plans in long term. These challenges and issues require the
government, enterprises, and producers to re-structure and plan the general agricultural
sectors. The farmers have to make production choices between the alternative crops in
their arable lands or fields to increase the productivities and maximize the incomes
subject to the farms’ production conditions and the market demands.
   The conventional economic wisdom would propose that the country should utilize its
scarce resources and specialize in producing agricultural commodities which have
stronger competitive advantages and generate higher adding values (Yu et al., 2010).
The fundamental economic problem is how to allocate limited resources in order to
ensure social welfare, including full employment and high living standards for all today
and in the future (Latruffe, 2010). However, the scarcity of resources forces us to make
choices by answering three basic economic questions: what goods to produce, how to
produce, and for whom to produce (Begg et al, 2005). The matter is how to respond to
the questions or what economic indicators support us to make the choices.
Competitiveness is a central concept and measure in stimulating policy and business
strategy discussions by policymakers, farmers, enterprises, and researchers. Researchers
                                             3



and policy makers are interested in which sectors can contribute the most to nation’s
economic growth and they often turn to the concept of competitiveness as a basis for
analysis. Enterprises and farmers are interested in which businesses make the most
profit for them and they also refer to competitiveness as a key indicator (Latruffe, 2010).
The researchers are interested in which sectors can contribute the most to nation’s
economic growth and they often turn to the concept of competitiveness as a basis for
analysis. The enterprises and the farmers are interested in which businesses make the
most profit for them and they also refer to competitiveness as a key indicator.
   Competitiveness is a relatively broad subject and concept which is related to various
economic theories and empirical literature. Though there is much agreement on the
economic and social importance of competitiveness indicators to make choice decisions,
it is less clear what exactly competitiveness is and what its most important determinants
of competitiveness are (Fischer and Schornberg, 2007; Martin, 2003). The concept is
widely researched from the classical economic theory and employed in both theoretical
and empirical studies from different points of view but there is little agreement on its
definition (Bojnec and Ferto, 2009). There are various frameworks to assess the
competitiveness at various levels with different research objectives according to six
main disciplines as follows: (i) the economic and production indicators of
competitiveness; (ii) the trade performance indices; (iii) the determinants of
competitiveness; (iv) the multidimensional frameworks; (v) the value chain performance
approaches; and (vi) the benchmarking. In this thesis, the authors will employ the first
and second approaches to achieve the research objectives (the authors’ review, 2017).
The main measures for agricultural competitiveness in economic literature are the
economic indicators and the trade indices. These competitiveness approaches indicate
the different economic literature and provide diverse policy implications. It is, therefore,
necessary to compare and test the consistency between these approaches.

   For decades, Vietnam and the ASEAN countries have paid more attention to the
agricultural export strategies based on the competitive advantage to utilize the scare
natural and social resources and take advantages of the regional and global integration
to maximize the economic and social welfare. The establishment of the ASEAN
Economic Community (AEC) in 2015 with objectives of a single market, a competitive
economic region, equitable economic development, and integration into the global
economy offers both opportunities and challenges to the member countries. The AEC
involves liberalizing trade in goods and services; protecting and promoting investment;
narrowing down the social and economic development gap; and enhancing the free flow
of skilled labor and freer flow of capital. Moreover, the ASEAN has signed free trade
agreements with dialogue partner countries such as Australia & New Zealand, China,
India, Japan, and Republic of Korea with different objectives, namely, strengthening
ASEAN’s trade and economic relationship with the partners, improving the economic
competitiveness of ASEAN countries as well as increasing the living standard,
enhancing economic integration of ASEAN countries, and creating of a more enormous
free market. The RCEP is proposed for a free trade agreement between these partners
with taking into account the EAFTA and the CEPEA. The AEC offers the opportunities
in the form of a huge market of US$2.6 trillion and over 622 million people in 2014.
The ASEAN area is collectively the third largest economy in Asia and the seventh
largest economy in the world (ASEAN, 2017). Petri et al. (2012) believe that the
ASEAN economic integration could gain a similar result to those coming from the
European market, amounting to 5.3 percent of the region’s income. The benefits could
be doubled if regional integration also leads to new free trade agreements with key
external partners and the whole region will share in these benefits.
   However, there are various challenges to the AEC member countries and obstacles
to the AEC progress. Although the ASEAN countries are diverse in terms of social,
economic, and political structures, they are in a similar geographical area and natural
                                             5



conditions (Siah et al., 2009) and these issues may cause the countries to become
substitutable or competitive for each other in agricultural products. The economic
integration among the AEC members encounters the internal obstacles consisting of the
import substitution policies of industrialization; the small extent of intra-ASEAN trade;
and the wide differences in economic size, development level, and industrial
competence giving rise to divergent perceptions of benefits and costs (Chia, 2013). The
ASEAN countries face the external challenges from strong globalization, international
competition, the rapid economic and trade growth in India and China, and the
proliferation of preferential trade agreements (Chia, 2013; Ravenhill, 2008).
   In general, Vietnam has strong comparative advantages and exports the traditional,
labor-intensive, and land-intensive agricultural sectors such as rice, coffee, rubber, black
pepper, fisher, fruit and vegetables based on the natural conditions and cheap labor
resources. The process of agricultural production development and international trade
specialization has occurred without a central and long-term plan and strategy based on
the scientific background and research. This process results in various issues to Vietnam
such as: (i) the country’s agricultural sector is losing the comparative advantages on the
world markets due to the increasing input cost, low product quality, and negative impact
on the natural environment; (ii) farmers and producers obtain lower profitability and
income due to low export price, oversupply production, low brand values, low value-
added, and low productivity; (iii) competitions become more and more fierce on both
local and global markets when competing countries (such as Thailand, Cambodia) focus
on the high-value sectors with high-quality standards and valuable brand names; (iv)
natural disasters, negative impacts on environments, and climate changes also make the
agricultural productions become riskier, more unstable and less profitable.
   In addition, crop choice for specific agro-ecological regions basing on their
competitive advantages is a key issue of Vietnam’s agricultural sector. For instance, the
Mekong Delta is the main agricultural area of Vietnam with the strategic sectors of rice,
                                             6



fruits, and vegetables. Rice, however, become less profitable and sustainable due to
input cost increase, oversupply, and environmental food-prints for both private and
social actors. These issues compel farmers, enterprises, and policymakers to urgently
identify and choose the best crops in the same arable lands with the similar natural and
social conditions. As the result, it is essential for Vietnam to identify the
competitiveness of agricultural sector to re-structure the agricultural production systems
and trade patterns which may generate the higher value-added and profitability for
producers and also properly adapt to climate changes and natural resource degradations.
1.2.   Research gap identification
   Vietnam’s agricultural sector plays the essential role in the economy, the sector has
been encountering various problems, and competitiveness is a key pillar in economic
theory. However, the studies which comprehensively investigate Vietnam’s agricultural
competitiveness at the country - sector level and/or commodity level with the
comparisons to the ASEAN countries by various approaches seem to be relatively
limited. Moreover, the application of different approaches may give different meanings
of agricultural competitiveness and lead to the differences in the results.
   As the authors’ review, there are six main approaches measuring competitiveness
such as the economic indicators, the trade performance indices, the determinants of
competitiveness, the multidimensional frameworks, the value chain performance and the
benchmarking. The trade performance indices and economic indicators are the most
popular and efficient measures in agricultural research.
   Many trade performance indices have been proposed such as the RCA by Balassa
(1965), the RTA by Vollrath (1991), the LFI by Lafay (1992), the RSCA by Dalum et
al. (1998), and the NRCA by Yu et al. (2009). In Vietnam, the studies mainly employ
the trade index of the RCA to measure the comparative advantages of one agricultural
commodity (Nguyen and Sumalde, 2008) or of all commodities in general (Le, 2010;
Nguyen, 2011; and Vixathep, 2013). There is no research utilizing the trade
                                            7



performance indices such as the RCA, the RTA, and the NRCA to assess the static and
dynamics competitiveness of Vietnam. Especially, there is no study testing the
consistency of the trade performance indices in the case of Vietnam. Therefore, there is
an empirical and theoretical research gap to assess the static and dynamics agricultural
competitiveness of Vietnam over time by various trade performance indices with the
consistency between these indices by cross-sections.
   In the international scope, measuring and comparing the agricultural trade
competitiveness among various countries in a region or a group is significantly
interesting to the scholars by these various trade indices (Banterle and Carraresi, 2007;
Qineti et al., 2008; Sanidas and Shin, 2010; Svatos et al., 2010; Bojnec and Ferto 2016).
These studies mainly focus on assessing the commodity structure of agrarian trades of
countries on the world market or a common regional market. Scholars, moreover, may
analyze the agricultural complementarity, similarity, and/or competition among different
countries on the world market or a common regional market by using the agrarian trade
data (Vaillant and Ons, 2002; Zheng and Qi, 2007; Benedictis and Tajoli, 2008;
Andreosso-O'Callaghan, 2009; Jayawickrama and Thangavelu, 2010; Shuai and Wang,
2011). However, scholars have not measured and compared the static and dynamics
agricultural competitiveness of the ASEAN countries over time by various trade
performance indices with the consistency test between these indices by cross-countries.
Especially, the assessment of the agricultural complementarity, similarity, and/or
competition between the ASEAN countries is still a significant research gap so far.
Some scholar may study the intra-industry trade, intra-regional trade, and bilateral trade
between these countries (Sharma and Chua, 2000; Ismail and Abdullah, 2013; Nguyen
et al., 2017; Nguyen and Vo, 2017).
   The economic indicators consist of the profitability, the value-added, the
effectiveness, the efficiency, and the productivity at both market and social prices. The
economic indicators are meaningful and essential tools to make crop production choices
                                            8



between alternative agricultural production systems by farmers and enterprises. Studies
in Vietnam usually measure the economic indicators of the agricultural productions at
market prices to identify whether the agricultural products are competitive or profitable
(Vo and Nguyen, 2011; Tran et al., 2013; Tran and Pham, 2014; Vo et al., 2015;
Nguyen, 2015; Truong et al., 2015; Hoang, 2015; Nguyen and Nguyen, 2018). Some
scholars measure the competitiveness or profitability of the agricultural product at social
prices by the DRC indicator (Nguyen and Sumalde, 2006; Nguyen 2009; Nguyen and
Mai, 2012; Nguyen and Phan, 2012). The studies, however, explain the competitive
advantage as the measurement by comparing the domestic resource cost valued at
market price (DRC) with the official exchange rate (OER). They convert the market
price DRCs into foreign currency value to identify whether an agricultural production
activity is competitive. Moreover, none of these researches assess the comparative
advantage changes when the input and market conditions change. This approach seems
not to strictly follow the guide of the original method of the PAM model by Monke and
Pearson (1989). Nguyen and Heidhues (2004) employ the PAM model for assessing the
comparative advantage of Vietnam’s rice sector under different liberalisation scenarios
with the sensitive analysis based on the various scenarios. This paper, however, focuses
on rice production only. It, therefore, fails to compare the comparative advantages of the
different agricultural productions.
   In the world scope, there are several studies of agricultural competitiveness by the
economic indicators in the PAM model (Yao, 1997a, 1997b; Morrison and Balcombe,
2002; Kydd et al., 1997; Gorton et al., 2006; Liefert et al., 2011; Bernal et al., 2012;
Alves et al., 2017) with sensitive analysis based on the changes of input conditions.
These studies, however, focus on measuring the competitiveness of an agricultural
product or the general agricultural sector. Only Yao (1997a) measures and compares the
comparative advantages of three competitive crops such as rice, soybean, and
mungbean. These crops, however, seem to be relatively similar in production and
                                               9



economic result. Yao (1997a) uses the economic indicators in the PAM model only
without theoretically comparing with other approach of competitiveness measurement.
There is no scholar who employs and compares the different approaches of investigating
the agricultural competitiveness. As the result, it is a practical and empirical research
gap to measure and compare the competing agricultural production systems of rice,
coconut, and pomelo. There is also a theoretical research gap to compare the economic
and trade approaches of measuring the agricultural competitiveness.
1.3.   Research objectives and questions
   In general, this dissertation aims to provide the comprehensive and systematic
overview    of    competitiveness     literature   and   to   investigate   the   agricultural
competitiveness of Vietnam at various levels and in diverse scopes by different
approaches under the country’s progress of economic re-structure, agricultural
production system innovation, and global market integration. In particular, the research
objectives of this dissertation are to:
   First, assess the static and dynamic agricultural competitiveness of Vietnam. The
study tries to understand the relative market shares of Vietnam’s agricultural commodity
groups on the world markets and identifies whether and how they are competitive, the
degrees of competitiveness by various trade performance indices. Vietnam has been
experienced the economic innovation and globalization, thus the dissertation has the
target to understand the general pattern of Vietnam’s agricultural competitiveness,
convergent or divergent, and explain how the competitiveness indicators of these
agricultural commodity groups change over time. The study also desires to know how
these trade performance indices are consistent in measuring, ranking and determining
the competitiveness in case of Vietnam’s agricultural sectors by cross-sections.
   Second, investigate and compare the agricultural trade patterns Vietnam in
comparison to the ASEAN countries. The authors attempt to understand the positions
and the advantages of Vietnam’s agricultural sector in the ASEAN region by
                                           10



investigating the agricultural competitiveness of other ASEAN countries, comparing the
agricultural competitiveness degrees, and ranking their positions over time. Especially,
the dissertation identifies whether the ASEAN countries are complementary or
substitutable in agricultural export and import on the world markets over the regional
and global integration process. The research, moreover, tests how these trade indices are
consistent in measuring, ranking and determining the competitiveness in case of
ASEAN countries’ agricultural sectors by cross-countries.
   Third, evaluate the agricultural comparative advantages of the alternative
agricultural production systems of rice, coconut, and pomelo in the same agro-
ecological conditions through the case study in Ben Tre province, Mekong Delta by the
economic and production approach. Ben Tre is selected due to its representative for
Mekong Delta, where rice and other crops as vegetables, coconut, and fruit trees may be
grown in large scales. Particularly, the dissertation measures and contrasts the economic
indicators of these sectors at market prices and social prices of inputs and outputs. The
study, moreover, analyzes the sensitivities of the economic indicators according to the
changes in climate, productivity, market prices, and exchange.
   To comparing various approaches of competitiveness measurements, the study also
assesses the comparative advantages of the sectors of rice, coconuts and pomelo by the
trade performance indices. Based on the results of both empirical studies by the
economic indicators and trade performance indices, the dissertation will:
   Fourth, empirically analyze the consistency and theoretically compare the
differences and implications of these competitiveness trade indices and economic
indicators. Though both the trade and economic frameworks are useful to measure the
competitiveness of agriculture, they indicate the different practical and theoretical
meaning and aspects. The authors would aspire to understand, test and illustrate how
and why these approaches are different and what the indicators can provide the
implications and suggestions for farmers, agribusiness enterprises, and policymakers.
                                           11



   The following research questions should be responded so that the research objectives
of this these previously can be completely and originally achieved.
   (1) The first research objective requires the main research question as follows: Does
Vietnam obtain the comparative advantages in agriculture on the world agricultural
markets over time? Other supporting research questions are also helpful for the first
research objective such as: How do these competitiveness indicators change over the
period of Vietnam’s economic re-structure, agricultural production system innovation,
and global integration? Whether the trade indices are consistent to measure, rank, and
determine the agricultural competitiveness in case of Vietnam by cross-sections?
   (2) The second research objective can be obtained by responding the following main
research question: How competitive are the ASEAN countries in agricultural sectors on
the world markets and whether these countries are complementary or substitutable in
agricultural export and import on the world markets? Moreover, other supporting
research questions are also meaningful for the second research objective such as: How is
Vietnam’s agriculture competitive in comparison with the ASEAN countries? Whether
the trade indices are consistent to measure, rank, and determine the agricultural
competitiveness in case of the ASEAN countries by cross-countries?
   (3) The third research objective should be determined by the research question that
which the crops of rice, coconut, and pomelo in Ben Tre obtain stronger comparative
advantages and should farmers and agribusiness enterprises cultivate and invest under
the conditions of the unstable agricultural markets, the changing climate, degrading
natural resources, and increasing competition? In other words, how competitive the crop
production systems of rice, coconut, and pomelo are. And,
   (4) The fourth research objective will be obtained by the research question that
whether, how and why trade performance indices and economic indicators are consistent
and/or different in measuring the agricultural competitiveness and providing practical
and theoretical implications?

1.4.   Brief of research methodology, scope, and data
   In economic and business literature, there are various frameworks to measure the
agricultural competitiveness at different levels in diverse scopes based on six main
approaches such as (1) the trade performance indices; (2); the economic and production
indicators, (3) the determinants of competitiveness; (4) the multidimensional
frameworks; (5) the value chain performance approaches; and (6) the benchmarking. In
this dissertation, the authors will employ the trade performance and the economic and
production approaches to achieve the research objectives and respond the research
questions. Moreover, the additional methods will be used to for other research
objectives and questions. The methodologies can be shortly expressed as follows with
detailed presentations in Chapter 3:
   First, the dissertation employs the trade performance indices to measure the static
agricultural competitiveness of Vietnam by cross-sections. The trade indices consist of
the Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) of Balassa (1965), the Relative Trade
Advantage (RTA) of Vollrath (1991), and the Normalized Revealed Comparative
Advantage (NRCA) of Yu et al. (2009). After that, the dynamics and changes of the
agricultural competitiveness indicators are analyzed in three ways such as OLS
regression, Markov matrices, and trend analysis. The consistency of these trade indices
in measuring, ranking, and determining the agricultural competitiveness in case of
Vietnam by cross-sections are tested by statistical tools based on the approach of
Ballance et al. (1987) and Seyoum (2007).
   Second, these trade performance indices are also employed to measure and rank the
agricultural competitiveness of the ASEAN countries by cross-countries. The dynamics
and changes of the agricultural competitiveness indicators of these countries are also
analyzed in similar ways. In addition, the study employs the trade complementarity
index (TCI) of Drysdale (1969) and the Export Similarity Index (SI) of Finger and
Kreinin (1979), and Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients (SC), following
                                            13



Jayawickrama and Thangavelu (2010), to identify whether the ASEAN countries are
complementary or substitutable (competing) in agricultural export and import on the
world agricultural markets. These statistical tools are also used to test the consistency of
these trade performance indices as cardinal, ordinal and dichotomous measures in case
of ASEAN countries by cross-countries.
   Third, the economic and production approach should be utilized to evaluate the
comparative advantage of alternative crop production systems such as rice, coconut, and
pomelo. Particularly, the policy analysis matrix (PAM) indicators are used to measure
the cost, the benefit, the profitability at both market and social prices. The PAM
indicators include the Private profitability (PP), Private cost ratio (PCR), Social
profitability (SP), Domestic resource cost (DRC), Social cost-benefit (SCB), Nominal
Protection Coefficient (NPC), Effective Protection Coefficient (EPC), Profitability
Coefficient (PC), Subsidy Ratio to Producers (SRP). Moreover, the authors measure the
sensitivity of the PAM indicators by three scenarios: (i) Climate change; (ii) Water and
land charges; and (iii) The parameters of the PAM variables and elements such as output
prices, inputs prices, productivity, and the real effective exchange rate. Finally, based on
the research results of trade performance indices and the economic indicators, this study
will theoretically discuss and compare the consistency and the difference of these
approaches in empirically measuring the agricultural competitiveness and providing
practical and theoretical implications.
   The dissertation is fulfilled over the period 2013-2017 with the focus on agricultural
commodities (commodity is defined as the sector in this dissertation) in Vietnam,
ASEAN countries, and Ben Tre province. The core scope of this dissertation is
Vietnam’s agriculture with 61 commodity groups. The extended scope is the ASEAN
countries’ agricultural sectors for comparing and ranking Vietnam’s agricultural
competitiveness positions. The narrowed scope is Ben Tre province as a case study of
the PAM approach for three alternative and competing crops of rice, coconut, and
                                            14



pomelo on the same arable land. Rice is the essential food crop, coconut is the important
material crop, and pomelo is the relatively potential crop. The PAM approach requires
relatively numerous data with the average values for all observers and these data of
Vietnam are not available in secondary sources. Moreover, Ben Tre has the strongest
advantage in coconut and pomelo and relatively strong advantage in rice. Thus, Ben Tre
should be the most adequate and feasible case for this research purpose, even though the
province is not the best representative for rice in the Mekong Delta.
   For the first and the second goals, the authors use the secondary data from the United
Nations Comtrade (UN Comtrade) with 61 agricultural commodity groups at 3-digits in
SITC Rev. 3 over the period 1997 – 2014 for Vietnam and 1997 – 2015 for ASEAN
countries. The dissertation also uses the secondary data from the International Trade
Center (ITC), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Bank (WB), the
General Statistics Office (GSO) of Vietnam, and the General Department of Vietnam
Customs (GDVC). The primary data from the fieldwork surveys for three agricultural
production systems in the case of Ben Tre province and related locations in 2017 are
employed for the third and fourth objectives. The actors in the value chains will be
interviewed such as farmers, middle traders, processors, wholesalers, and retailers and
the supporting actors also such as governments, banks, logistics companies, experts, and
others. The secondary data for these objectives are also obtained from the UN
Comtrade, the ITC, the FAO, the GSO of Vietnam, and the GDVC.
1.5.   Expected significance and contribution
   The dissertation is the initial attempt to measure the static comparative advantage of
all agricultural items with 61 commodity groups at 3-digit level in the SITC Rev. 3 over
the period 1997-2014 by various trade performance indices of the RCA, the RTA, and
the NRCA. The result will provide the overview picture of Vietnam’s agricultural
comparative advantages and the competitiveness rankings of the agricultural commodity
groups which are the key and strategic indicators for policymakers, agribusiness
                                           15



enterprises, and farmers to make agricultural policies and business decisions. The
dissertation is the first research trying to explain how does Vietnam’s agricultural
comparative advantage patterns change over time at the different stages of its global
integration and predicts the trends in the future by employing different approaches of
OLS regression, Markov matrices, and trend analysis. The study, moreover, provides the
empirical tests of the various trade performance indices and dynamics analysis models
in the case of Vietnam based on the cross-sections comparison. Finally, the research
provides the theoretical analysis of the consistency between these trade performance
indices by the cross-sections rankings in case of Vietnam.
   Vietnam, moreover, has been strongly and deeply integrated into the regional and
global market and economy. Therefore, it is important to understand the rankings and
competitiveness of Vietnam’s agriculture under the analysis and comparison with the
ASEAN countries. This dissertation is the novel research which investigates the
agricultural competitiveness patterns, agricultural competitiveness rankings, and
agricultural competitiveness dynamics of the ASEAN countries with 61 commodity
groups at 3-digit level in the SITC Rev. 3 over the period 1997-2015 by various trade
performance indices. Especially, the dissertation tries to identify whether the ASEAN
countries complementary or substitutable on the world agricultural market over the
regional and global integration process by employing the trade complementarity and
similarity indices and Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients for competitiveness
indices. These findings provide the vital complementarity and competitiveness
indicators for organizational business strategies, national development and trade
policies, and regional integration programs. In addition, the research expands the
empirical studies of the complementarity and competitiveness indices in the ASEAN
context based on the cross-countries comparison. The study tests the theoretical analysis
of the consistency between these trade indices by the cross-sections rankings in the case
study of the ASEAN countries.
                                            16



   The trade indices are able to be successful to assess the agricultural performance
competitiveness at the country aggregation level and the export aspect. They, however,
cannot explain why the country obtains the relative market shares on the world markets
and fail to indicate the welfare and benefits aspects by which the farmers, agribusiness
enterprises, and the agricultural governments make crop choice decisions, development
strategies, and agricultural policies. It is, moreover, significant and novel to compare the
different approaches of measuring competitiveness, the trade performance indices and
the economic indicators. This thesis is the first and new effort to measure and compare
the competitiveness of competing crops of rice, coconut, and pomelo in the same arable
lands of Ben Tre province by the PAM indicators. The research, moreover, analyzes the
sensitivities of the competitiveness indicators according to the climate, market, and
policy changes. Especially, the thesis measures the competitiveness of rice, coconut, and
pomelo by trade performance indices. The result is used to theoretically compare and
illustrate the difference and the implication of trade indices and economic indicators.
   From both practical and empirical aspects, it is essential to investigate the static and
dynamic agricultural competitiveness of Vietnam over time. Especially, it will more
significant to understand Vietnam’ agricultural competitiveness in comparison and
ranking with other ASEAN countries under its regional and global integration.
Moreover, it is completely meaningful to understand the welfare and benefit view of
competitiveness of the competing crops in the same arable land. From academic and
empirical aspect, it is novel to theoretically compare and illustrate the difference and
implication of trade indices and economic indicators.
1.6.   The structure and outline of the dissertation
   The dissertation consists of seven chapters. This Chapter introduces the study by
highlighting the overview of the agricultural sector of Vietnam and the competitiveness
literature, identifying the research gap and significance, presenting the research
objectives and questions, and explaining shortly research methodology, scope, and data.

                    CHAPTER 2:           LITERATURE REVIEW
      The result of the literature review shows that competitiveness is relatively large,
general and multi-perspectives concept and theory in various thought schools. Thus
scholars should specifically and effectively define the concept based on the research
objectives and conditions. The review also indicates that there are various approaches to
measure the competitiveness according to six main disciplines such as: (i) the economic
and production indicators; (ii) the trade performance indices; (iii) the determinants of
competitiveness; (iv) the multidimensional frameworks; (v) the value chain performance
approaches; and (vi) the benchmarking. The trade performance indices and economic
indicators are the most popular and efficient measures in agricultural research.
2.1      Definition of competitiveness
      In the economic literature, there are various definitions of competitiveness which are
identified and modified appropriately for the research objectives and conditions.
However, they are generally incompatible with each other in some cases and are not
universally accepted. The main debates and discussion of competitiveness definition are
as follows: (i) the distinction between comparative advantage and competitive
advantage or competitiveness; (ii) the levels, scopes, and subjects of the
competitiveness: economics and business; micro and macro; supranational union,
nation, region or province, value chain, industry or sector, commodity, and individual
firm or farm; and the nature of competitiveness as performance, process, potential, and
determinant; and (iii) the senses, objectives, perspectives of the competitiveness concept
and definition.
      In general, the concepts of comparative advantage and competitive advantage are
usually employed indistinguishably and interchangeably. They are, however, sometimes
used in parallel for indicating different concepts and meanings. The main distinction
between the concepts is that the competitive advantage concept measures a country’s
profitability in one sector at market prices that may be distorted by policy or other
                                           19



influences, while the comparative advantage reflects the profitability at shadow prices
that reflect the social value of costs and production without these distortions. The
distinction is, however, not well established in the literature (USAID, 1999; Siggel and
Ssemogerere, 2004). The studies that follow the distinction employ policy analysis
matrix method to assess the comparative advantage of a country in an activity.
Moreover, comparative advantage is intended to compare countries’ industrial structures
rather than comparing the competitiveness of the industries directly. In other words,
comparative advantage represents the efficient allocation of resources at the national
level whilst competitive advantage indicates the commercial performance of individual
firms (Kannapiran and Fleming, 1999). According to Frohberg and Hartman (1997), the
concept of competitive advantage is closely linked to the comparative advantage and the
only difference between the two concepts is that the competitive advantage includes
market distortions, whereas the comparative advantage does not.
   The second debate on competitiveness is whether it is a national-level or firm-level
issue, what the levels and scopes of competitiveness are. Sharples (1990) argues that
comparative advantage is a theoretical concept that explains the trade and optimal
welfare in an undistorted world while competitive advantage relates to the observable
practices. If they are able to survive and increase market share, they have become more
competitive and vice versa. It is notable that an increase in competitiveness of a firm or
an industry resulting from government support may not necessarily imply an increase in
national welfare. Thus, competitiveness does not have a definition in economic theory,
Sharples concludes. According to Krugman (1994), competitiveness is a firm-level issue
and firms rather than nations compete for exports on the world market. On the other
hand, Lall (2001) views competitiveness as a national matter and Garelli (2002) stresses
that competition takes place between nations rather than firms. These scholars further
explain that not only goods and services exported by firms but also the abilities of
nations to develop a well-functioning education system and to improve technological
                                            20



capabilities are vital for competitiveness. Thus competitiveness is to evaluate how
nations and enterprises manage their full competencies to achieve prosperity or profit.
   The scholars and the empirical studies generally agree that the concept of
competitiveness is employed in both economic and business research at various levels
depending on the research objectives, scopes, and subjects. Buckley et al. (1998)
generally review that competitiveness is measured at the levels of country, industry,
firm, and product. Hatzichronologou (1996) explains the levels of competitiveness as
the ability of companies, industries, regions, nations, and supranational regions. Coy
(2006), however, views the nation and the region competitiveness as macro level and
industry, firm, commodity competitiveness as micro level. He, therefore, divides
competitiveness concept into macro- and micro-levels with the meta-level linking social
relations to the macro-level and the meso-level linking macro- and micro-levels. Coy
concludes that the meso-level suggests policies to enhance the competitiveness of
certain sectors at the micro-level, given a stable macroeconomic environment.
Moreover, competitiveness concept, in the scope of business and at micro level, should
be explained and measured with the relations among various subjects or entities which
horizontally and vertically link and cooperate together to compete and achieve market
shares in a value chain which is particularly for the studies of agricultural industry
competitiveness (Aramyan et al. 2007; Gorton et al. 2013). The competitiveness is also
indicated in the different natures as the resources and results. Buckley et al. (1998)
identify three natures of competitiveness such as potential, process, and performance.
   The most important and complicated discussion of competitiveness is to define the
senses, objectives, and perspectives of the competitiveness concept. Oxford advanced
learner’s dictionary 8th edition defines competitiveness as derivatives of “competitive”
which means the following: (i) used to describe a situation in which people and
organizations compete against each other; (ii) as good as or better than others; (iii) (of a
person) trying very hard to be better than others. The definition is comprehensive and
                                            21



dynamic with the meaning of competing, being better, and the effort or process of
competing and being better at both individual and organizational levels. The term of
competitiveness originated from the Classical Latin word “petere” implying to seek,
attack, aim at, desire, and the Latin prefix “con-” indicating together (Siudek and
Zawojska, 2015). The classical and the neo-classical scholars generally synonymize
competitiveness concept as the comparative advantage of a nation.
   The concept of competitiveness is stated and explained variously in modern
economics. Freebairn (1987) defines competitiveness as the ability to supply goods and
services at the time, place and form sought by overseas buyers at prices as good as or
better than those of other suppliers while earning at least the opportunity cost of returns
on resources employed. In the medium and long term, competitiveness is the capacity of
a country to sustain and expand its share of international markets and at the same time to
improve its people's standard of living. These require the increase of productivity and
therefore the incorporation of technological advances (Fajnzylber, 1988). Porter (1990b)
explains that the only meaningful concept of competitiveness at the national level is
productivity. The principal goal of a nation is to produce a high and rising standard of
living for its citizens. The ability to do so depends on the productivity with which a
nation’s labor and capital are employed. Productivity is the value of the output produced
by a unit of labor or capital.
   Master (1995) defines comparative advantage to be an activity’s marginal
contribution to national income (social profit), while competitiveness is the marginal
contribution to the net income of the owners (private profit). He explains that an activity
creating positive social profit is said to be economically efficient and to have a
comparative advantage against other activities. The Organization for Economic Co-
operation and Development (OECD) defines competitiveness as “the ability of the
companies, industries, regions, nations, and supranational regions to generate while
being and remaining exposed to international competition, relatively high and rising
                                           22



income and factor employment levels on a sustainable basis (Hatzichronologou, 1996).
The European Commission (EU, 2003) suggests the definition that competitiveness is
“the ability of an economy to provide its population with high rising standards of living
and high level of employment for all those willing to work, on a sustainable basis”. A
more specific definition in international trade, the United National Conference on Trade
and Development (UNCTAD) describes the international competitiveness as “from
meaning simply higher exports to diversifying the export basket, sustaining higher rates
of export growth over time, upgrading the technological and skill content of export
activity, to expanding the base of domestic companies able to compete globally”
(UNCTAD, 2002). Aiginger (2006) clarifies competitiveness as the ability of a country
or location to create welfare, maintaining that a comprehensive evaluation contains an
output and a process evaluation, claiming that the output evaluation is closely related to
a welfare assessment, and process evaluation is related to the analysis of production and
technology functions. Ozcelik (2012), based on the international trade center (ITC,
2007), interprets competitiveness as “the advantage a country has in exporting a certain
product over other countries”.
   According to Cai et al. (2009), comparative advantage can be analyzed from two
different perspectives: static and dynamic. In a static sense, the concept is a term
employed to compare entities’ current optimal specialization and trade patterns. In a
dynamic sense, it is used to compare entities’ future optimal specialization and trade
patterns by recognizing that an entity’s relative ability to competitively produce certain
goods can be improved over time, in response to a variety of endogenous and exogenous
factors such as changes in factor endowments and their opportunity costs, changes in
production and marketing technologies, and changes in world input and output prices.
   In conclusion, the thesis does not distinguish the concepts of competitiveness,
competitive advantage, and comparative advantage. Competitiveness is defined as the
performance of an entity (a country, a sector, or a firm) to obtain the higher relative
                                           23



market shares on the global markets based on the relatively lower domestic costs to
maximize and increase the social welfare both at present and in the future. The authors
would accept and harmonize the differences of senses, objectives, and perspectives in
the definitions of competitiveness among scholars and schools of thought. The next
section in this chapter will focus on reviewing the evolution of competitiveness theory.
2.2      Evolution of competitiveness theory
      The concept of competitiveness in traditional economic theory is synonymous with
comparative advantage. The term of nation's international competitiveness in classical
theories is based on the concepts of absolute advantage and comparative advantage
proposed by Smith (1776) and Ricardo (1817). Cost, productivity, efficiency, and
specialization are the fundamentals of these concepts. Smith (1776) explains the wealth
of a nation based on absolute advantage. In particular, absolute advantage means the
export of the goods with lower domestic cost to partner countries and the import of
goods with higher domestic cost. This is the initial theory and basic indicator of a
nation’s competitiveness. Production requires the use of society’s element of value,
namely human labor. Smith notes that some countries, due to the workers’ skills or the
quality of natural resources, could produce the same commodities as others with fewer
labor hours. These countries have absolute advantages in the products and they should
specialize in producing and supplying the goods to the world markets. Smith confirms
that access to larger markets permits faster productivity growths and higher income
levels, primarily because it permits more specialization and competition. However,
Smith’s economic and competitiveness theory fails to explain the international trade of
the countries without the absolute advantage in any products.
      Ricardo (1817) expands the international trade theory and develops a theory of
comparative advantage based on the absolute advantage concept. The comparative
advantage is broader than Smith’s theory and successfully deals with the drawback of
the absolute advantage theory. Similar to the absolute advantage, the comparative
                                           24



advantage measures a nation’s competitiveness by the relatively lower production cost
which is assumed to be unit labor cost. Ricardo explains the benefit from international
trade for countries if they export goods or service when producing at relatively lower
labor costs and import goods or service that are relatively more expensive due to higher
labor costs. The theory of comparative advantage is useful to explain the reasons why
international trade may happen and how international trade increases the welfare of the
countries. The Ricardian theory, however, has limitations such as (i) it predicts an
extreme degree of specialization, but in practice countries produce not one but many
products; (ii) the theory explains trade based on differences in productivity (or cost)
levels between countries, but does not explain why these differences exist; (iii) the
production costs consist of various input factors apart from labor cost; (iv) it fails to
explain how the gains from trade are divided among trading countries; and (v) the model
does not explain the roles of demand in the international trade (Cho and Moon, 2002;
Esterhuizen, 2006). In spite of these limitations, scholars have developed the empirical
models to measure the competitiveness of a country based on the international economic
theories of Smith and Ricardo such as the revealed comparative advantage index of
Balassa (1965), the intra-industry trade of Grubel and Lloyd (1975), the relative export
advantage and the relative trade advantage of Vollrath (1991), the Lafay index of the
Lafay (1992), the trade competitiveness (Greenaway and Milner, 1993), the revealed
symmetric comparative advantage index of Dalum et al. (1998), and the normalized
revealed comparative advantage of Yu et al. (2009.
   Mill (1848) endorses the free international trade based on the law of comparative
advantage and remarks that some trade and economic activities may be profitable only if
the government intervenes and protects them over the period of learning-by-doing. He
argues that the trade restrictions against comparative advantage generate transfers to a
few beneficiaries at the expense of other market participants. Mill continues the actual
barter terms of trade depend not only on domestic costs but also on the pattern of
                                             25



demands. Specifically, international commodity exchange depends on demand for a
country’s product in the foreign market. He also supposes that the value of an imported
good is the value of the product exported to pay for it. Mill’s trade theory balances the
roles of production factor and demand factor in a nation’s competitiveness.
   The classical theory discovers the law of comparative advantage and specialization
in international trade while the key contribution of the neoclassical models is to identify
the sources of comparative advantage and specialization and to explain why one
industry can profitably expand while others cannot (Masters, 1995). Heckscher (1919)
and Ohlin (1933) suggest the theory of factor proportions and form the major theory of
international trade. Whilst Smith and Ricardo emphasize a labor cost in production
value, the factor proportions theory is based on a more modern and practical concept of
production that raises capital to the same level to labor. The theory assumes that there
are two countries, two commodities, and two factors of capital and labor. The countries
differ from each other according to the production factors of they own and the
commodities differ from each other according to the proportions of input factors
required for the production. If a country is wealthy in one factor - labor, for instance - in
comparison with the others it will have comparative advantage in, produce and export
the labor-intensive good without reaching complete specialization under free trade. The
logic follows that the more abundant the factor, the lower the cost.
   Leontief (1953) conducts an empirical study of H-O theory in the case of the US
with the expectation that the US, the most capital-abundant economy in the world,
should export capital-intensive goods and import labor-intensive goods. He, however,
finds out that the US import-competing goods require 30 percent more capital per
worker than its export goods. This finding proves the opposite of what the H-O model
predicted. The result has been known as Leontief's paradox. Rybczynski (1955) expands
the factor endowment theorem that at constant relative goods prices, an increase in the
endowment of one factor will lead to a more than proportional expansion of the output
                                            26



in the sector which utilizes that factor intensively, and an absolute decrease of the output
of the other goods.
   Stolper and Samuelson (1941) explain the relationship between output and input
prices in a country. The scholars express that a change in the output price of goods will
result in a change in the input price of the factor used intensively for the good’s
production with the same direction and at the higher degree. The theory highlights that
opening trade increases the real value to the abundant factor and decreases the real value
of the scarce factor. Samuelson (1962), moreover, demonstrates the factor price
equalization theory. It proves that the free trade tends to equalize the prices of goods and
factor across countries even when the factors are immobile between the two countries.
Samuelson also assesses the impact of domestic demand on comparative advantage and
confirms that even if there is no difference across countries in technology, factor-
intensity, and resource endowments, they could find mutually-advantageous trade in
exporting goods they dislike and importing products they prefer to consume.
   Salter (1959) investigates the impact of exchange rate on comparative advantage and
explains that not all goods consumed domestically can be traded internationally. Goods
with high transport cost relative to their value may not be traded and thus the price will
not be influenced by import and export. For a given level of domestic prices and
inflation, a higher currency exchange rate leads to more goods being exported and fewer
being imported. Vernon (1966) analyzes the relationship between the comparative
advantage and the product cycle. The scholar supposes that the comparative advantage
changes from one country to another and these changes depend on the stage of
development of each product. It should be noted that Vernon includes innovation and
technology as two additional factors of productions.
   On the demand side, Linder (1961) develops the theory of country similarity as a
possible resolution to the Leontief paradox. The scholar focuses on the trade of the
manufacturing commodities and bases on two assumptions: First, countries export
                                           27



products with significant local demand in order to utilize the existent economy of scale
and to improve new products with the already known local customers. Second,
demanding countries have similar tastes and income levels. The Linder’s theory deduces
that the international trade in manufactured goods will be greater between nations with
similar levels of per capita income and similar demand structures rather than between
those with dissimilar per capita income levels and demand structures. In other words,
international trade will still occur between two countries with identical preferences and
factor endowments. The goods that will be traded are those for which there is an
overlapping demand or consumers in both countries are demanding the same products.
Thus the intra-industry trade occurs because of product differentiation. The comparative
advantage seems to cease to be useful when intra-industry trade is explained. Similar
income levels and diverse tastes influence the demand side, while in a monopolistic
market structure, economies of scale and special production technology have effect on
the supply side (Coy, 2006). The traditional trade model fails to explain towards the
intra-industry trade as under the assumptions countries with identical factor endowments
would not trade while Lancaster (1980) shows that intra-industry trade certainly occurs
even when the economies are absolutely identical in all respects and can persist under
conditions of comparative advantage. The theory of intra-industry trade has been grown
out of the empirical studies of Balassa (1966) and Grubel (1967). These scholars
analyze the impact on trade among EEC countries resulting from increasing economic
integration. The findings confirm that trade expansion of EEC countries is primarily
intra-industry rather than inter-industry for industrial products. These results are
surprising and contrary to traditional trade theory. Helpman and Krugman (1999)
conclude that comparative advantage drives inter-industry trade through specialization
while economies of scale drive intra-industry trade.
   Krugman et al. (2012), moreover, remark that that the international trade is not
necessary from the result of comparative advantage. Instead, it may come from
                                           28



increasing returns or economies of scale, that is, from a tendency of unit costs to be
lower with larger output. Economies of scale provide countries an incentive to
specialize and trade even when countries are similar in their resources or technology.
Economies of scale can be internal - depending on the size of the company or external -
depending on the scale of the sector. The new trade theory founded by Krugman (1980)
focuses on the role of increasing returns to scale and network effects. The theory
confirms the actual pattern of trade among similarly endowed countries in respect of
factor endowments, tastes, technology as against the traditional theory of trade among
differently endowed countries. The theory argues that using protectionist tools to
generate large industries since they are infant industries will allow those sectors to
dominate the world market (Krugman, 1980). This theory is supported strongly in the
real world by the practical policy and research of business incubators. It has become
complicated to explain and identify the sources of modern trade flows in the real world.
   The gravity model of trade is employed first by Tinbergen (1962) to presents a more
empirical analysis of trading patterns and to predict the bilateral trade flows based on
the economic sizes - often using GDP indicator and distance between two countries.
Moreover, scholars have constructed a new Ricardian trade theory by combining with
the theories of H-O and intra-industry trade with the many-country and many-product
basis in a form to include intermediate input trade for the most general case of many
countries and many goods. The capitals are also considered as goods which is produced
and input in the production. The new Ricardian theory with many-country and many-
commodity model allows choosing production techniques and trade of input goods and
determining wages according to the productivity of countries (McKenzie, 1954; Jones,
1961; Dornbusch et al., 1977, Davis, 1995; Shiozawa, 2007).
   A new concept of competitiveness is developed by an analysis of examining case
studies of successful industries to identify why they are located in particular countries
(Porter, 1990a). According to Porter, the national prosperity is generated, not inherited.
                                            29



It does not grow from a country’s natural endowments, labors, interest rates, or
currency’s value as classical economics stated. The competitiveness of a nation depends
upon the capacity of its industry to innovate and upgrade. Companies gain
competitiveness against the world’s best competitors because of pressure and challenge.
He argues that countries benefit from having factor conditions; demand conditions;
related and supporting industries; and firm strategy, structure, and rivalry. In addition,
there are two outside determinants such as government and chance.
   Scholars, however, criticize that Porter’s competitive advantage framework mainly
come from developed countries and newly industrialized countries. They assert that his
interpretation of competitiveness as being too general and not applicable to every
country (Coy, 2006). Rugman (1991, 1992) argues that Porter’s single diamond has two
flaws: first, the multinational activity is not properly incorporated; and second, the role
of government is understated and unclear. Bosch and Prooijen (1992), moreover, add
that the impact of national culture on a nation’s competitive advantage is given too little
attention in Porter’s model. Krugman (1994) remarkably states that competitiveness is a
meaningless word when applied to national economics and the obsession with
competitiveness is both wrong and dangerous. If national competitiveness is interpreted
in broad terms, as ability to produce income or productivity growth, it can be simply
considered as part of a development or growth strategy - there is no need to consider it
separately, Krugman adds. In the study of the competitive advantages of nations, Smith
(2010) supposes that “there are two schools of thought on country competitiveness: the
economic school, which rejects Porter’s notion of country competitiveness, and the
management school, which supports the notion of competitiveness at a country level”.
   Rugman and D’Cruz (1993) state that in a world of free trade, Porter’s concept of
home market, and hence the size and shape of the model, needed to be modified. In
particular, they argue that the Canada-USA free trade agreement means that the
Canadian diamond is really a Canada-USA diamond. The reason is that Canadian
                                           30



manufacturers, for example, can and must respond to USA buyer needs and have ready
access to USA supplier firms. Rugman and D’Cruz also disagree with Porter’s treatment
of multinational firms, citing the major contribution that such firms make to the
Canadian economy, even though the firms may not consider Canada as their domestic
market. The authors propose the double diamond model combining Canada and USA
markets and suggest that managers build upon both domestic and foreign diamonds to
become globally competitive in terms of survival, profitability and growth. According to
Moon et al. (1995), the Double Diamond model may fit for Canada, Europe, and
countries with free trade agreement. It, however, does not apply well to other small
nations such as Korea and Singapore. Thus, Moon et al. (1995) adapt the model to the
generalized double diamond for properly analyzing small economies. In this model,
firms from small countries target their resources and markets in both domestic market
and international market. Therefore, a nation’s competitiveness depends partly upon the
domestic diamond and partly upon the global diamond related to its firms. The
difference between the international and domestic diamond represents international or
multinational activities. The multinational activities include both outbound and inbound
foreign direct investment.
   Cho (1994) argues that Porter’s diamond is limited in its application to developing
countries such as Korea and modifies the model to take into account the Korean context.
He divides the sources of international competitiveness into two broad pillars:
“physical” factors and “human” factors. By physical factors, Cho refers to endowed
resources, the business environment, related and supporting industries and domestic
demand. By human factors, the author includes workers, politicians and bureaucrats,
entrepreneurs and professional managers and engineers. By creating, motivating and
controlling the four physical elements, these human factors drive the national economy
from one stage of international competitiveness to the next. An external factor of chance
is added to these eight internal factors to make the new paradigm a nine-factor model.
                                            31



The importance of each of the eight physical and human factors changes as the national
economy moves from a less developed stage to a developing stage, to a semi-developed
stage and finally to a fully developed stage.
   The recent competitiveness theory has been developed under mixed approaches with
various views and indicators. There are several competitiveness models of the mixed
approaches such as the global competitiveness index (GCI) and the global travel &
tourism report (GTTR) of the world economic forum (WEF), the world competitiveness
yearbook (WCY) of IMD world competitiveness (IMD) (Bris, 2014), the urban
competitiveness reports (UCR) (Ni, 2012), the national competitiveness index (NCI)
(Kao et al., 2008), the province competitiveness index of Vietnam (PCI), and Vietnam
competitiveness report (Ketels et al., 2010). The GCI, WCY, and the NCI are the most
popular and complete frameworks. The WEF, based on Schwab’s original idea of 1979,
has published the GCI. The index includes 114 indicators grouped into 12 pillars: Pillar
1: institutions; Pillar 2: infrastructure; Pillar 3: macroeconomic environment; Pillar 4:
health and primary education; Pillar 5: higher education and training; Pillar 6: goods
market efficiency; Pillar 7: labor market efficiency; Pillar 8: financial market
development; Pillar 9: technological readiness; Pillar 10: market size; Pillar 11: business
sophistication; Pillar 12: and innovation. These pillars are in turn classified into three
sub-indexes:   Basic    requirements,   Efficiency   enhancers,    and   Innovation    and
Sophistication factors. The WCY evaluates and ranks the ability of nations to produce
and sustain an environment which maintain the competitiveness of enterprises. The
authors assume that wealth creation takes place primarily at enterprise level and it is
considered as the competitiveness of enterprises. The enterprises operate in a national
environment which enhances their capacity to compete in local or foreign markets and it
is called the competitiveness of nations and is captured by the WCY. The WCY
framework divides the national environment into four main factors: (i) Economic
Performance; (ii) Government Efficiency; (iii) Business Efficiency; and (iv)
                                            32



Infrastructure. In turn, these factors are divided into 5 sub-factors which emphasize
every aspect of the areas under study. The WCY features 20 sub-factors with 338
criteria and each sub-factor might not have the same number of criteria. The NCI is
developed by Kao et al. (2008) for the 10 Southeast Asian countries. The concept of
national competitiveness is a measure of the relative ability of a country to generate and
sustain an environment in which enterprises can compete so that the level of prosperity
can be improved. The first level of the model comprises four primary factors: economy,
technology, human resource, and management. Each primary factor, in turn, is
constituted of sixteen secondary factors at the second level and there are 116 criteria in
total for four primary factors
   Value chain approach is recently popular and important to explain the success,
performance, and growth of a country in a sector. The complexity that value chain
actors face is the conflicting goals and benefits of individual actors in the chain. Each
individual actor has its own goals, performance indicators and optimization criteria.
Therefore, an adequate and integrated performance measurement system needs to be
proposed to measure the success of supply chain. The performance indicators should
represent both effectiveness and efficiency of the supply chain and its actors. Van der
Vorst (2000) classifies the performance indicators into three levels: (i) the supply chain;
(ii) the organization level; and (iii) the process level. Aramyan et al. (2007) propose a
framework with four main factors: (1) efficiency; (2) flexibility; (3) responsiveness; (4)
and food quality. The factors include various sub-indicators. Gorton et al (2013)
comprehensively review the theoretical literature and empirical studies in the agri-food
competitiveness and develop a conceptual framework for analyzing sustainable product
chain competitiveness based on a set of indicators which are required to be
comprehensive, illuminating, verifiable, useable, and comparable. The model comprises
5 factors: (i) relationships between agents and domains; (ii) sphere of enterprise such as
farms, food manufacturers and retailers; (iii) customers such as prices, safety, wellbeing
                                              33



and satisfaction; (iv) policy makers and government; (v) and natural environment such
as biodiversity, climate.

   Benchmarking is a desirable tool to improve organizations’ and nations’
performances and competitiveness. Greene (1993) explains benchmarking as a critical
                                             34



technique for making organization transformation easy. The tool provides the authority
and provokes the humility for change. Greene adds that applying benchmarking requires
a certain threshold of willpower from company, this is important itself. Camp (1989)
and Zairi (1996) consider benchmarking as a strategic technique to compare
organizational practice and product improvement and to determine the key elements of
competitiveness. Kovacic (2007) confirms that the goal of benchmarking is to enhance
the competitive ranks of nations, industries and organizations through internal and
external knowledge, combining the best in gaining superiority.
      The competitiveness theory, in conclusion, starts with the international trade theory
and tends to become multi-approaches at various levels, in different scopes, for several
entities or subjects with different components, perspectives, and indicators to define and
measure the concept. The evolution of competitiveness theory can be systematically
summarized in Table 2-1. The next parts of this chapter will review the measuring
frameworks of competitiveness in general and in agriculture particularly.
2.3      Frameworks of competitiveness
      The different competitiveness definitions require different measuring frameworks to
capture the precise and suitable elements of the concepts. The useful measures have to
specify the unit of analysis (country, region, industry, sector, firm, and commodity) and
compass the competitive performance, its sustainability through the creation of
competitive potential and the management of the competitive process (Buckley et al,
1988). In general, researchers employ mainly two scientific approaches to measure and
analyze competitiveness, namely models and indicators. The economic models capture
the interaction of national resources, production technology, product demand, and
government interventions (Master, 1995). However, economic models are usually
custom-build to answer specific questions and require a large investment in data
collection and analysis (Esterhuizen, 2006). The popular alternative to models is index-
                                            35



number indicators generated to measure the comparisons across entities, the changes
over time, and to serve as thermometers, not weather forecasters (Masters, 1995).
   An important aspect of competitiveness framework is that it is a relative and
comparing measure. There is always a comparison with a basic value. If market share is
being analyzed, it must concern the market size. If competitiveness in factor markets is
being assessed, a factor would have the relation to the value in another production
processes (Frohberg and Hartman, 1997). Buckley et al (1988) categorizes the measures
of competitiveness into three groups: competitive performance, competitive potential,
and management process for each unit of analysis (Table 2-2). The category indicates
that there are many different indicators to measure the competitiveness of each unit of
analysis such as country, industry, firm and product. The different research objectives
require different assessing methods.

   Esterhuizen (2006) systematizes twelve methods to measure competitiveness at
different levels and units based on Buckley et al. (1988). He aggregates the potential and
process of competitiveness together. He adds the Porter’s model and business
confidence index for the South Africa social and economic conditions. Latruffe (2010)
focuses on the measures of the competitiveness, the productivity, and the efficiency in
agricultural sectors and categorizes the measuring indicators into three groups: (i) the
trade measures of competitiveness; (ii) the strategic management measures of
competitiveness; and (iii) the determinants of competitiveness which are controlled by
firms/farms and beyond controlled by firms/farms.
   There are, generally, various methodologies to assess the competitiveness of
different entities at different levels depending on the concept definitions and research
objectives. This thesis systematically and comprehensively reviews the theoretical and
empirical literature and gathers different approaches into six categories with the focus
on the agricultural sector as follows: (i) the economic and production indicators of
competitiveness; (ii) the trade performance indices of competitiveness; (iii) the
determinants   of   competitiveness;    (iv)    the   multidimensional   frameworks    of
competitiveness; (v) the value chain performance frameworks; and (vi) the
benchmarking. In this thesis, the authors will employ the economic indicators and the
trade performance indices to achieve the research objectives. Those two approaches will
be reviewed particularly for employment in the empirical studies while the other
approaches should also be surveyed for a general and structural understanding of the
competitiveness measuring frameworks.
2.3.1 Economic and production indicators
   In the classical and neo-classical theories, economists measure the international
competitiveness by the cost, the price, and the productivity. Smith (1776) explains that
the countries have an absolute advantage in the products of the lower cost or the higher
productivity goods to partner countries and they should specialize in producing and
                                             37



supplying the goods to other countries. Ricardo (1817) expands the international trade
theory with comparative advantage concept based on the relative lower cost or the
higher productivity. Heckscher (1919) – Ohlin (1933) theory states that countries differ
from each other according to the factors of production they possess and the commodities
differ from each other according to the proportions of input factors that are required for
the production of these goods. If a country is relatively wealthy in one factor – labor, for
instance – compared with the others it will have comparative advantage and produce the
labor-intensive good, and will therefore export it without necessarily reaching complete
specialization under the free trade. The logic follows that the more abundant the factor,
the lower the cost. The profitability, the productivity, the efficiency, the value-added,
and the cost obviously are, therefore, considered as the basic indicators to assess the
competitiveness of a firm, an industry, and a nation.
   The competitiveness concept can be explained and measured in the different
economic ways. According to Harrison and Kennedy (1997), firms with positive profit
and high productivity illustrate that there are a high level of barriers keeping the entry of
new firms from the industry. Carpinetti et al. (2000) explain that competitiveness is
dependent mainly on the ability to perform well the economic and business dimensions
such as cost, quality, reliability, innovation and flexibility to adapt the changes in
demand. The growing productivity, efficiency, investment in machinery, innovations
and other mechanisms of restructuring can enable firms to grab market share from their
rivals, even in economic crisis (Voulgaris and Lemonakis, 2014). Singh et al., 2008
stress that in most of studies of the firm competitiveness, the competitiveness of an
organization can be also measured by certain financial parameters.
   O’Mahoney and van Ark (2003) focus on productivity differences which lead to a
large extent differences in competitiveness. These authors consider the growth in labor
productivity (or value-added) as performance indicator. According to Wijnands et al.
(2008), comparative advantage has the following two dimensions: (i) cost of uniqueness
                                           38



advantage: this needs a comparison between domestic and foreign sectors; (ii) and
efficiency gap between sectors: because even if a sector works well, the others may
perform even better. The economic indicators for evaluating the food competitiveness
recognizes both the comparative advantage of products and the competition for
production factors, and they might be defined as: (i) the annual growth in a subsector’s
share of the real value-added compared with growth in the total food industry; (ii) the
annual growth of the Balassa index; (iii) the annual in the export share on the world
market; (iv) the annual growth in the labor productivity of the food sectors; and (v) the
annual growth in the real value-added of the food sectors (O’Mahoney and van Ark,
2003; Wijnands et al., 2008).
   Bavorora (2003) analyzes the impact of policy measures such as tariff regulations,
export allowance, and production support on the competitiveness of the sugar sector in
Czech. The competitiveness is identified by the increase of the concentration, the labor
the productivity, the technology, the profitability, and the relative trade advantage. The
author indicates that the liberal political tools, together with a low protection of
domestic products, lead to the enforcement of competitiveness in the local market and to
the decrease of sugar production down to the level of consumption in the country.
   Fischer and Schornberg (2007) synthesized previous approaches and defined
competitiveness (𝐶𝑂𝑀𝑃𝑠 ) as a function of profitability (𝑃𝑅𝑂𝑆 ), efficiency (𝐸𝐹𝐹𝑆 ) (or
productivity), and growth (𝐺𝑅𝑂𝑆 ). The scholars calculate a composite measure for
relative and multi-dimensional economic performance as assessed by the profitability,
the productivity, as well as the output growth in the case of the food and drink
manufacturing sectors in 13 European countries.
                            𝐶𝑂𝑀𝑃𝑠 = 𝑓(𝑃𝑅𝑂𝑆 , 𝐸𝐹𝐹𝑆 , 𝐺𝑅𝑂𝑆 )
where PROs is the share of gross operating surplus in turnover, EFFs is value-added per
employee, and GROs is the annual change of production value.

   Hoang (2015) evaluates and compares the competitiveness of different agribusiness
sectors based on value chain approach with different measures such as efficiency and
productivity indicators. The efficiency indicators are calculated by revenue per
intermediate cost (P/IC), value-added per intermediate cost (VA/IC), and net profit per
intermediate cost (NPr/IC). The productivity indicators are calculated by revenue per
hectare of farm (P/ha), value-added per hectare (VA/ha), net profit per hectare (NPr/ha),
and income per hectare (INCOME/ha).
   Monke and Pearson (1989) propose the policy analysis matrix (PAM) to enable the
comparative analysis of production systems based on the private profitability and the
social profitability. According to Michalek (1995), the PAM model obtains several
critical advantages as follows: (i) the model is specific enough to account for the most
important economic relations between the macro and micro indicators with time and
data constraints; (ii) it is appropriate to analyze the price and production efficiency; (iii)
it may assess the impact of policies on the incomes of farmers; (iv) the model can
identify the magnitude of the income transfers between producers, consumers and the
policy’s budget; (v) it measures the key coefficients relating to the level of protection
and comparative advantage of a sector; and (vi) the results can be properly
disaggregated between different types of firms, regions, and products. Despite
advantages, as in all quantitative methods, the model has limitations: first, the PAM is
static model; secondly, perfect substitution between the domestic and foreign tradable
commodities is usually and strictly assumed; third, only under certain restrictive
behavioral assumptions (such as supply and demand elasticities equal to zero) are
estimated income transfers identical to producer and consumer surplus; and fourth,
plentiful and non-market data (which is not always easily available and precise) is
needed to examine the performance of a given production system. In conclusion, the
PAM yields various indicators (i) first to measure the comparative advantage of a
sector; (ii) second to assess the impacts of government policies, market failures, and
                                            40



economic performance elements; and (iii) third to assess the dynamics and trends of
comparative advantages based on the scenario analysis and time data. It is remarkably
useful and meaningful that the PAM model can compare both the different production
systems for the identical outputs and the various outputs from the same production
systems. In other words, scholars may compare the competitiveness of different
countries or locations in an agricultural commodity and contrast the competitiveness of
different agricultural commodities in a country or location.
   First, the DRC indicator in the PAM model is a measure of international price
competitiveness. According to Bruno (1972), the basic idea of this literature is to
evaluate the social profitability of an investment by comparing the real total opportunity
costs of production with actual social benefits, where both sides of the account are
corrected for all measurable market distortions. A crop investment decision should be
adopted if the net marginal profit is positive. The index compares the opportunity costs
of the domestic production factors to the value-added which is created by these
production factors (Tsakok, 1990). The different tools in the PAM model identify the
profitability of the production chain links and the chain as a whole, before and after
investment; discover the most efficient and the weakest links in a chain; and compute
the cost saving after investment (Monke and Pearson, 1998; Alves et al., 2017). The
PAM compares the various commodity production systems, thus the model provides a
good tool for investigating which commodity production systems have comparative
advantages (Morrison and Balcombe, 2002).
   Second, the PAM provides the useful tools to assess the impacts of agricultural
policies and the market failures on the competitiveness. The agricultural policies and the
market failures may distort and change the production and market elements of the
agricultural products. The agricultural policies are the public decisions to influence on
the input and output prices, public investments, benefit allocation, and sales market
(import or export) (Bernal et al., 2012; Liefert et al., 2011). According to Bernal et al.,
                                            41



(2012), the agricultural policies may be classified into three groups: the agricultural
price policies, macro-policies, and public investment policies. Specifically, a distorting
policy is government intervention making market prices to be different from the
efficient valuation. Taxes and subsidies, international trade restrictions, and price
regulations may result in divergence from the efficient valuation. These distorting
policies are usually founded to achieve non-efficiency objectives such as income
growth, food security, equity, and safety (Pearson et al., 2003; Bernal et al., 2012).
Liefert et al. (2011) further remark that many countries restrict the food exports to help
domestic consumers increasing the goods volume and lowering the purchase price. This,
however, hurts the domestic producers and results in a net welfare loss for the country.
On the contrary, the PAM may also measure the net impact of the efficient policies on
commodity production system which are designed by the government to correct the
market failures (Kydd et al., 1997).
   The PAM evaluates the influence of market failures on the revenues, costs, and
profits of a commodity production. In other words, market failures may lead to
divergence from the efficient price valuations and they are generated when price
mechanisms cannot reach the competitive results or efficient prices. The common types
of market failures in agricultural market are (i) monopoly: the purchase or sales power
belong to some people and they control the market prices; (ii) imperfect competition:
the situation where suppliers (or consumers) are able to influence prices because they
are too small and there is no other market; (iii) missing market: market fails to supply
the necessary goods by the private sector; (iv) negative externality: the cost or effect of
a product or activity on other people but it is not taken into account; (v) information
asymmetry: market information is not full and accuracy enough during a market
transaction; (vi) unstable market: the price, supply, and demand change strongly and
seriously impact on the poor and weak people; and (vii) inequality: the unfair
distribution of profit, income, and welfare among the actors in a value chain or people in
                                              42



a society. Environmental negative impact is a typical externality of market failures and
it is popularly assessed by the PAM. There are two types of environmental market
failures: negative environmental externality and environmental degradation. Negative
environmental externality is related to the utilizations of soil, water, air, and forest
which result in the direct and immediate costs and effects on other people but cannot be
charged while environmental degradation refers to the misusages of natural resources
such as soil, water, and air which impose the future costs and effects (Baumol and
Oates, 1988; Monke and Pearson, 1998; Kydd et al., 1997; Bernal et al., 2012).
   The PAM is a static model and it cannot capture the prospective shifts in input and
output prices, productivity, and other natural, social and market conditions. The model,
therefore, may generate the unrealistic results in the dynamic sense and potential biased
against public policies (Mane-Kapaj et al., 2010; Yao 1997a). The model, however, may
project or estimate the comparative advantage dynamics in the future based on the
assuming scenario or time data as the third function of the model. Sensitivity analysis
provides a tool of assessing the impact of changes in assumptions and errors (such as
exchange rates, global prices, production yield change due to environmental
degradation) in estimating profitability and projecting competitiveness. It can be applied
to both private and social estimations (Monke and Pearson, 1998; Gorton et al., 2006).
According to Monke and Pearson (1998), there are two ways of sensitive analysis: the
first is involved to the calculation of breakeven values for social profitability with other
fixed initial values and the second is the elasticity of social profitability with respect to a
particular parameter with a change in the parameter of interest by an arbitrary
percentage. Scholars, moreover, estimate the comparative advantage indicators based on
different scenario which are assumed to happen potentially in the future, such as
regional and global integrations, market conditions, natural environments, and
government policies (Yao, 1997b; Gorton et al., 2006). Morrison and Balcombe (2002),
moreover, remark that the traditional sensitivity analyses are relatively involved to
                                            43



bootstrapping technique. Thus, the sensitivity analyses can be performed by testing how
estimates changes when parameters or variables of interest are varied.
   According to Masters and Winter-Nelson (1995), because the DRC ratio is based on
the cost of non-tradable inputs, it understates the competitiveness of activities that use
mainly such domestic factors in comparison to those that rely more on tradable inputs.
The authors propose the social cost-benefit (SCB) ratio to overcome this shortcoming.
Using the same data as for the DRC ratio but in a different relationship, the SCB ratio is
defined as the ratio of the sum of domestic (non-tradable) and tradable input cost to the
price of the good considered. The domestic resource cost ratio and policy analysis
matrix have been employed widely to measure comparative advantages and assess
government’s intervention policies in both empirical and practical studies. The notations
and descriptions of the SCB ratio are the same as in the DRC indicator. A domestic
production is competitive when the SCB is less than 1, as it reveals that total input costs
are less than the revenue derived from the good.
   There are numerous empirical studies on comparative advantages applying the DRC,
the SCB, and other indicators from the PAM. Yao (1997a, 1997b) evaluates the costs
and benefits of the Thai agricultural diversification policy by the PAM framework for
three crops of rice, soybeans, and mung beans in two provinces in Thailand. The result
indicates that rice sector is more competitive than soybeans and mung beans and the
government policy may cause the efficiency reduction. The author also analyzes the
sensitivity of comparative advantages when the products prices, inputs prices, water
charges, environmental impact and soil fertility change. Estudillo et al. (1999) measure
the comparative advantage in rice production in the Philippines for the three decades
and find out that Philippines achieves comparative advantage in rice production due to
new technology in the early period but it lost the comparative advantage completely by
1990. The DRC is especially used to compare the competitiveness among countries.
Gorton et al. (2000) assess the competitiveness of agricultural productions in Bulgaria
                                           44



and the Czech Republic in comparison with other the EU by the DRC and the RCA. The
study indicates that Czech and Bulgarian cereal producers are competitive at the world
and at EU market prices by the DRC ratio. However, they do not achieve revealed
comparative advantage in trade with the EU because of trade restriction policy. Liefert
(2002) employs the DRC and the SCB to measure Russia agricultural output and input
productions, and test the consistency of Russia agricultural trade with its comparative
advantage. The study indicates that the country has an advantage in agricultural inputs
compared with its agricultural outputs and also has an advantage in bulk crops in
comparison with meat production. The result also establishes that the comparative
advantage is consistency with agricultural production and trade for transition period.
Mohanty et al. (2003) measure the comparative advantage of Indian cotton production
by the PAM and show that without the intervention of government, cotton farmers may
move away from cotton to other crops for higher incomes. Makosholo and Jooste (2006)
assess the comparative economic advantage of irrigated long term crops such as
cherries, peaches, apples, and asparagus by the DRC and profitability coefficients. They
conclude that these sectors have been subsidized by different government’s policies and
especially the impact of the exchange rate. The authors also indicate that the policies of
land and water may have a remarkable influence on crops to reduce poverty. Yercan and
Isikli (2007) highlight the international competitiveness of Turkish horticultural sectors
such as tomato, melon, watermelon and tangerine. Mane-Kapaj et al. (2010) prove the
opposition of comparative advantage to profit. They assess the comparative advantage
of olive oil production in Albania by the PAM and show that the sector is profitable
while does not have a comparative advantage. Zheng et al. (2013) explain the impact of
government’s policy on the comparative advantages of agricultural sectors in China at
different levels. That intervention enhances comparative advantage in wheat production
while not significantly improves the comparative advantages of soybean and corn
productions. Hanson et al. (2013) show that the U.S. catfish production is losing
                                          45



comparative advantage. Its import tariff enhances catfish comparative advantage
position, but may not raise its profitability. Ohlan (2014) uses the DRC to measure the
competitiveness of Indian milk sector and the result shows the country has price
comparative advantage in mild production and its market share is growing up.
   There are also empirical studies employing the DRC and the PAM to assess the
comparative advantage of agricultural production in Vietnam. Nguyen and Heidhues
(2004) employed the PAM to assess the comparative advantage of Vietnam’s rice sector
under different liberalization scenarios. The authors express that Vietnam has a
comparative advantage in rice production and the comparative advantage is sensitive to
world rice price, shadow exchange rate, land rent, social labor costs, and fertilizer
import price. Nguyen and Sumalde (2008) measure the comparative advantage of
shrimp production by the DRC, the RCA, and net social profitability. The results
indicate that Vietnamese shrimp production obtains comparative advantage and it is
strongly sensitive to feed price, exchange rate, shrimp yield, wage, and shrimp export
price. Nguyen (2009) evaluates the comparative advantage of maize and soybean
production for animal feed processing in Son La, Dak Lak, Dong Nai and Ha Tay
provinces of Vietnam. The author shows that Son La and Dak Lak have comparative
advantage in maize production while Dong Nai and Ha Tay do not; Dak Lak, Son La,
Dong Nai have comparative advantages in soybean productions while Ha Tay does not.
Nguyen and Mai (2012) present comparative advantage in coffee production of Dak Lak
province and the comparative advantage is highly sensitive to coffee export price.
Huynh and Yabe (2013) show the comparative advantage of soybean production in
Vietnam while farmers obtain low income from the crop. They stress that the
government policy has no positive impact on the production but reduces the
comparative advantage of the sector. Le et al. (2015) study the comparative advantage
of lychee in Bac Giang province. The paper confirms that lychee production has
comparative advantage; and VietGAP standard, lychee world price, its yield, and
                                           46



exchange rate have positive impact on comparative advantage while labor costs, input
prices, and interest rate have negative affect. Most of these empirical studies employ the
FX premium to transfer the private price to social price. There are, so far, no studies
assessing and comparing the comparative advantages of alternative crops in the same
arable lands over time to understand how farmers adopt and change their crops.
   Studies in Vietnam usually measure the economic indicators of the agricultural
productions at market prices to identify whether the agricultural products are
competitive or profitable (Vo and Nguyen, 2011; Tran et al., 2013; Tran and Pham,
2014; Vo et al., 2015; Nguyen, 2015; Truong et al., 2015; Hoang, 2015; Nguyen and
Nguyen, 2018). Some scholars measure the competitiveness or profitability of the
agricultural product at social prices by the DRC indicator (Nguyen and Sumalde, 2006;
Nguyen 2009; Nguyen and Mai, 2012; Nguyen and Phan, 2012). The studies, however,
explain the competitive advantage as the measurement by comparing the domestic
resource cost valued at market price (DRC) with the official exchange rate (OER). They
convert the market price DRCs into foreign currency value to identify whether an
agricultural production activity is competitive. Moreover, none of these researches
assess the comparative advantage changes when the input and market conditions
change. This approach seems not to strictly follow the guide of the original method of
the PAM model by Monke and Pearson (1989). Nguyen and Heidhues (2004) employ
the PAM model for assessing the comparative advantage of Vietnam’s rice sector under
different liberalisation scenarios with the sensitive analysis based on the various
scenarios. This paper, however, focuses on rice production only.
   In conclusion, the authors will utilize economic indicators such as the PP, the PCR,
the SP, the DRC, and the SCB in the PAM to measure the comparative advantages of
the alternative agricultural production systems of rice, coconut, and pomelo in Ben Tre.

2.3.2 Trade performance indices
   The economic and production indicators are significantly important and meaningful
to understand the result and the welfare created by an industry for related actors and
society. The indicators, however, require the detailed data of inputs and outputs of all
observations or actors to calculate. As the result, it seems to be impossible to investigate
and compare the competitiveness of several sectors among many countries over a
period. The trade data is relatively complete and available. Therefore, the trade
performance approach should be a good solution for the research problem.
Various empirical frameworks have been developed and modified to measure the
comparative advantage and international trade performance of a country in a sector
based on the traditional theory of international trade such as the revealed comparative
advantage, the relative trade advantage, the normalized revealed comparative advantage,
the Grubel-Lloyd index, the Lafay index, and other basic trade performance indicators
such the net export index, export growth in value, export share in national exports,
export share in world market. When the data of cost, price and productivity for all
commodities and all countries are fully not available, the measure of comparative
advantage based on “revealed” data is the best option.
   Balassa (1965) proposes the index of revealed comparative advantage (RCA) based
on the classical theory of international trade and adjusted from Liesner’s (1958) first
utilization. The main idea of the RCA index is to compare the performance of a country
in a commodity with the performance of a reference group of countries using export
flows by using the observed export patterns or the revealed data. In other words, the
index calculates the ratio of a country’s export share of one commodity in the
international market to the country’s export share of all other commodities. Balassa
argues that comparative advantage is revealed in relatively high shares of export
markets and comparative disadvantage is revealed in relatively low shares of export
markets. The shares have to be compared with others to evaluate and identify whether
                                            48



and which countries and commodities have comparative advantage or disadvantage
(Gorton et al., 2000). There are concerns over the trade-distorting effects of government
interference and inability to identify the sources of comparative advantage, scholars and
the authors maintain the idea that the revealed comparative advantage index, when
employed judiciously, still gives useful evidence of the comparative advantages in agri-
food sectors. The RCA, therefore, is employed to investigate the comparative advantage
in several empirical studies such as French (2017), Bojnec and Ferto (2016), Nath et al.
(2015), Kuldilok et al. (2013), Yu et al. (2010), Lorde et al. (2010), Abidin and Loke
(2008), Banterle and Carraresi (2007), and Havrila and Gunawardana (2003).
   Although the RCA has been widely employed in several empirical studies, the index
has got various critical comments of limitations and it has been modified into different
frameworks and used in different ways. The main limitations of the RCA index are
criticized as follows: (i) at higher levels of commodity aggregation, the values of the
RCA are inconsistent with the comparative advantage as indicated by pre-trade relative
prices; (ii) it indicates a stronger comparative advantage for small countries with smaller
market share in the world export market and for small commodities with smaller market
share in the world export market; (iii) it serves as export specialization index than
comparative advantage indicator; (iv) the index is static and not presents the dynamics
of comparative advantage over time; (v) it does not include import data; (vi) the
distribution of the RCA indicators is asymmetric and non-normal; (vii) the value range
from 0 to + ∞ has problematic matters to interpret and compare; (viii) it double counts
the data of a country and a commodity; (ix) the index indicates the success in exporting
in the world market. The exports, however, can come from incentives and the incentives
can explain competitiveness, not comparative advantage (Hillman, 1980; Yeats, 1985;
Vollrath, 1991; Kreinin and Plummer, 1994; Dalum et al., 1998; Proudman and
Redding, 2000; Benedictis and Tamberi, 2004; Hoen and Oosterhaven, 2006; Yu et al.,
                                           49



2009; Bojnec and Ferto, 2015). In order to deal with the limitations of Balassa’s index,
there have been many modified and further developed models by scholars.
   Vollrath (1991) proposes the relative trade advantage (RTA) that is calculated as the
difference between the relative export advantage (RXA), which is similar to the RCA
index, and the relative import advantage (RMA). The major differences between
Balassa’s RCA and Vollrath’s indices are following: (i) the RXA (and RMA) eliminates
country and product double counting; (ii) it considers all traded goods and all countries
rather than subgroups and referring to global trade intensity; (iii) it uses export and
import data and, therefore, encompasses both the relative demand and relative supply
dimension; (iv) the RTA value is in (-∞, 0, +∞), that avoids the asymmetric problem of
the RCA values; (v) the index is more close to real competitive advantage than the RCA
when abstracting from distortionary influence; (vi) the RCA is more consistent with the
actual world phenomenon of two-way trade (Vollrath, 1991; Ferto and Hubbard, 2003;
Worz, 2005; Banterle and Carraresi, 2007; Crescimanno and Galati, 2014). The RTA,
however, is in contrast to the RCA when: (i) the RXA is smaller than the unity but
higher than the RMA, thus the RTA is higher than zero and shows competitive
advantage whilst the RCA shows comparative disadvantage; (ii) the RXA is higher than
the unity but smaller than the RMA, thus the RTA is smaller than zero and proves a
competitive disadvantage whilst the RCA indicates a comparative advantage. The RTA
has been employed in several empirical studies to analyze the competitive advantages
and trade performances of sectors in different countries such as Maksymets and
Lonnstedt (2016), Crescimanno et al. (2014), Camanzi e al. (2012), Bojnec and Ferto
(2009), Asciuto et al. (2008), Mosoma (2004), and Havrila and Gunawardana (2003).
   Vollrath (1991) proposes two more indices of international trade competitiveness:
the relative export advantage - REA which is formulated by the logarithm of the export
comparative advantage (lnRXA) to deal with the asymmetric problem of the RCAs’
distribution and the revealed competitiveness - RC that is the difference between
                                            50



logarithm of the export comparative advantage and the logarithm of import comparative
advantage (lnRXA - lnRMA). The RC, however, requires the existence of a country
exporting and importing the same commodity (exports and imports are nonzero) and it
is very sensitive to small values of exports and imports.
   Laursen (2015) and Dalum et al. (1998) stress that the RCA index is asymmetrical
and non-normal and should be made for the econometric analysis. Thus, the authors
transform the Balassa’s index into the measure of the revealed symmetric comparative
advantage (RSCA) that is simply defined as (RCA - 1)/(RCA + 1). The RSCA indicates
similar economic implications to the RCA. Dalum et al. (1998) use regression analysis
to test the dynamics of the RSCA values for particular commodity groups from one
period to the next. This index is also popularly used to measure the dynamics of
comparative advantage indicators over time such as Ban (2016), Lee (2011), Qineti et
al. (2009), and Sharma and Dietrich (2007).
   Kreinin and Plummer (1994) suggest a dynamic RCA model that is given as the
change in a commodity in a country’s exports relative to the change in the country’s
share in total world exports. The country is said to obtain a comparative advantage in a
commodity if its share in the country's total exports increased faster than the growth in
the share of the commodity in total world trade over the same period. Proudman and
Redding (2000) introduce an empirical framework for analyzing the dynamics of
international trade trends by modifying the RCA. Following the authors, an economy’s
comparative advantage in a sector is given by the ratio of its share of exports in the
sector to its average export share in all sectors; and the RCA may be evaluated by
analyzing the external shape of the RCA distribution. Valentine and Krasnik (2000)
based on the adapted RCA form of Hoekman and Djankov (1997) to calculate the RCA
for a period and its average annual growth rates. The approach has limitation for its
contrast with the static RCA results and specialization in a declining industry (Edwards
and Schoer, 2002). To deal with the shortcoming, Edwards and Schoer (2002) construct
                                           51



the dynamic indicator of the RCA by taking the logs of the RCA equation and then
differentiating totally. The indicator compares the growth in the share of a commodity in
total trade of a country with the growth in the share of the commodity in total trade of
the world. The Porter-adapted index of the revealed comparative advantage adds the
value of output produced by the country's outbound FDI to export value of the industry
in the RCA index, and Dunning-adapted net competitive advantage index excludes the
value of output produced by foreign FDI to import value of the industry in the formula
(Traill and Silva, 1996). Gorton et al. (2000) adapt the Balassa index to develop a
commodity weighting index and an EU share of exports index for the cases of Bulgaria,
Czech and EU. Hoen and Oosterhaven (2006) stress that the RCA ranges from 0 to + ∞
and the index has the problematic matters. The indicator may have a moving mean
larger than its expected value of 1 because of its multiplicative specification and the
distribution is dependent on the number of countries and sectors. The authors suggest
the additive RCA index ranging from - 1 to + 1 with a symmetric distribution that
centers on a stable mean of zero. Cai and Leung (2008) derive a more general index of
the RCA variation (RCAV) to analyze the change of RCA over time.
   According to Yu et al. (2009), these alternative RCA indices might improve the
RCA index in certain aspects, but none of them successfully overcome all the
shortcomings. These scholars, therefore, propose the normalized revealed comparative
advantage (NRCA) index as an alternative and improved measure of the RCA based on
the probabilistic approach of Kunimoto (1977). The NRCA index is expressed as the
normalized forms of the level deviations in actual trade flows from their expected levels.
The NRCA, in general, has four properties eliminating the drawbacks of Balassa’s
index. First, it is symmetrical as its value range from -0.25 to 0.25 with 0 being the
comparative-advantage-neutral point. Second, the sum and the mean value of a country
or a commodity’s NRCA scores are constant and equal to zero. This reflects the relative
nature of comparative advantage as when a country obtains comparative advantage in a
                                            52



commodity, some other countries must lose comparative advantage in this commodity,
and when a country obtains comparative advantage in some commodities it must lose
comparative advantage in some other commodities. Third, it is independent from the
classification of the commodities and countries. In other words, the aggregation levels
of data have no influence on the NRCA and the index is additive over country and
commodity. Hence, the Yu’s index is comparable across country, commodity and even
time and it provides a systemic tool for the assessment of comparative advantage over
space and time. Fourth, the NRCA captures the situation of zero export in a more
reasonable way as the NRCA score for zero export is not invariant. If two countries
have zero export of a commodity, the large country would have more comparative
disadvantage in this commodity than the small country; likewise, if a country has zero
export in two commodities, the country would have more comparative disadvantage in
the large commodity than in the small commodity (Yu et al., 2009). The NRCA index
has been employed in several empirical studies to measure the cross-sections and cross-
countries comparative advantages over time and to compare with other trade
performance indices such as Deb and Hauk (2017), Seleka and Kebakile (2017),
Ceglowski (2015), Ndayitwayeko et al. (2014, 2015), Sarker and Ratnasena (2014),
ShariatUllah and Kazuo (2012), Fourie (2010), and Sanidas (2009).
   There are, moreover, indices and methodologies to measure export or international
competitiveness such as the net export index (NEI), the Grubel and Lloyd intra-industry
trade index (GLI), the quality similarity index (QSI), the price similarity index (PRSI),
the constant market shares (CMS), the Lafay trade specialization index (LFI). The net
export index (NEI) is a popular and basic formula calculated by the country’s or sector’s
exports less its imports divided by the total value of a trade. The index considers the role
of exports and imports in trade balance and the assessment of the comparative
advantage in a commodity. The NEI has the advantage of calculating every good
separately and the number of goods would not impact the results. However, the NEI
                                            53



does not account for country’s size and not identify the importance of export and import
for the entire economy in terms of volumes (Fischer and Schornberg, 2007). The GLI,
developed by Grubel and Lloyd (1971), measures the level of intra-industry trade
(simultaneous exports and imports in the same industry) of a country at different levels
of aggregation. Antimiani and Henke (2007), with arguing that products with similar
prices also have similar qualities, developed a so-called “quality similarity index” (QSI),
which was inspired by the measurement of vertical and horizontal inter-industry trade.
Horizontal intra-industry trade refers to measuring the similarity of a country’s exports
and imports for sectors exhibiting similar qualities. Ozelic (2012) develops PRSI based
on QSI. The CMS is first applied to the study of international trade by Tyszynski
(1951). This index is a technique for analyzing trading patterns and trends for the
purpose of policy formulation. The technique is intended to shed light on the factors
underlying a country’s comparative export performance. Lafay (1992) proposes an
empirical framework to measure the comparative advantage or specialization of a
commodity in a country (LFI). The index measures the difference between each
product’s normalized trade balance and the total normalized trade balance. Then, the
result is weighted by each commodity’s share in overall trade. In this respect, the
comparative advantage is defined as the positive difference between the actual trade
deficit of one sector and the theoretical one, corresponding to its importance to trade.
The LFI has the advantage of eliminating the influence of cyclical factors, controlling
intra-industry trade and re-export flows by considering the importance of import,
allowing for a more precise analysis of the dynamic model descriptors of production
specialization, and taking into account any distortions induced by macroeconomic
ﬂuctuations. This index, however, excludes the world import and export data, therefore,
it is suitable for cross-commodity analysis only but not for cross-country comparison.
Its other shortcoming is to take a value close to zero for a commodity if the amounts of
both an import and an export are equivalent (Zaghini, 2005; Alessandrini et al., 2007).
                                             54



   Competition analysis among countries in a commodity on the global market is also
important for free trade agreements and economic integrations. There are various
methods to empirically analyze the complementarity, similarity, competition, and
substitutability between countries based on trade performance data. Drysdale (1969)
proposes the trade complementarity index (TCI) for an industry or a country in its
partner country or region. The TCI measures the extent to which a country’s export to
its partner country is relatively large since the product composition of the exporting
country matches that of importing country more closely than it matches the commodity
composition of the world trade. There are two measures of the level of trade
complementarity derived from the two-flow trades of these countries. The index then
has been modified and employed by scholars such as Vaillant and Ons (2002),
Andreosso-O'Callaghan (2009). Vollrath and Johnston (2001) propose a framework of
the trade complementarity index (TCIv) with the different components. The main parts
of this formula are the relative export advantage and the relative import advantage. The
TCIv measures the degree to which one country’s relative export share structure
corresponds with another’s across certain commodities. In other words, the index
assesses the market match between two countries - a country is selling what the other
country wants to buy (Yang and Chen, 2008). The TCIv is used in various empirical and
practical studies by authors such as Ng and Yeats (2003), Zhou et al. (2007), Hatab et al.
(2012), and Munemo (2013). The trade complementarity between two countries can be
measured by the bilateral trade flows and their trade flows to the world market using the
trade intensity index proposed by Kojima (1964) or Brown (1949). The index is
presented in two forms, namely the export intensity index and import intensity index.
These indices reflect the ratio of the share of a country’s trade with its partner relative to
the share of world trade destined for the partner (Wu and Zhou, 2006; Hatab et al.,
2012; Shuai and Wang, 2011).
                                            55



   The extent of the association between trade competitiveness indices of countries is
an excellent measure of complementarity between countries. The degree of the
association between trade competitiveness indices can be identified by using the
Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. In other words, by testing the ranks of
agricultural sectors in two countries, the correlation would explain the nature of the
products - substitutable or complementary - which are sold by the two countries
(Jayawickrama and Thangavelu, 2010; Setyari, 2015).
   According to Finger and Kreinin (1979), some propositions in international
economics can be explained by the use of an index measuring the similarity of the
exports of any two countries a third market. If exports are dissimilar, namely little or no
commodity overlap, then there is little scope for trade diversion. Observing changes
over time in the export similarity between two countries can assess the degree to which
their economic structure is becoming more similar or more divergent. Moreover, the
dynamics of similarity index may explain the changes of the capital flow, labor flow,
and economic structure (Wu and Chen, 2004; Benedictis and Tajoli, 2007). Finger and
Kreinin then propose the export similarity index (ESI) to identify the similarity of trade
patterns of countries in a common market. The measure involves to working out the
sector share of total exports for each country and, thereafter, for each pair of countries,
and to sum the minimum of the two countries’ shares for a given sector across all
sectors (Gathani and Stoelinga, 2013). The index has been empirically employed by
authors such as Nguyen et al. (2017), Shuai and Wang (2011), Andreosso-O'Callaghan
(2009), and Linnemann and Beers (1988).
   In Vietnam, the studies mainly employ the trade index of the RCA to measure the
comparative advantages of one agricultural commodity (Nguyen and Sumalde, 2008) or
of all commodities in general (Le, 2010; Nguyen, 2011; and Vixathep, 2013). There is
no research utilizing the trade performance indices such as the RCA, the RTA, and the
                                            56



NRCA to assess the static and dynamics competitiveness of Vietnam. Especially, there
is no study testing the consistency of the trade performance indices in Vietnam.
      In conclusion, this thesis will employ the RCA, the RTA, and the NRCA to measure
the comparative advantages of agricultural sectors in Vietnam and the ASEAN
countries. The dynamics of these indicators will be analyzed be various methods. The
agricultural complementarity and competition between the ASEAN countries will be
assessed by the TCI, the ESI, and the Spearman methods.
      Moreover, the other approaches of measuring the competitiveness of the agricultural
sector such as the determinants of competitiveness; the multidimensional frameworks of
competitiveness; the value chain performance frameworks; and the benchmarking in the
appendice part due to the limit of thesis’ page.
2.4      Summary and the general framework of the dissertation
      The literature review results indicate that the competitiveness is a relatively
diversified and large economic and business subject with the long and active evolution
of the theory. Competitiveness is not a single concept but a colorful and
multidimensional academic literature. It consists of various sub-concepts and thought
schools with various definitions. The different definitions of competitiveness present the
different economic, social, and environmental meanings and implications with the
different perspectives and components. Simultaneously, the different definitions of
competitiveness require the different frameworks to measure the concept. There are
various approaches to measure the competitiveness according to six main disciplines
such as: (i) the economic and production indicators; (ii) the trade performance indices;
(iii) the determinants of competitiveness; (iv) the multidimensional frameworks; (v) the
value chain performance approaches; and (vi) the benchmarking. The trade performance
indices and economic indicators are the most popular and efficient measures in
agricultural research. This thesis will employ these approaches to measure the
agricultural competitiveness and compare these frameworks.
                                              57



   The literature review results show that there is a significant research gap to
investigate the static and dynamic agricultural competitiveness of Vietnam, the ASEAN
countries, and Ben Tre province by various frameworks under the economic re-structure
and globalization process of Vietnam. The additional significant research gap is to
compare and analyze the consistency between different agricultural competitiveness
frameworks and approaches. Especially, there is no study assessing the agricultural
complementarity or competition between the ASEAN countries.
   In this thesis, competitiveness may be defined as the performance of an entity such
as a country, a sector or a commodity to obtain the higher relative market shares on the
global markets based on the relatively lower domestic costs to maximize and increase
the social welfare at present and in the future. The trade performance indices, the
economic frameworks, and the dynamics models of these indicators seem to the most
appropriately and properly satisfy the definition of agricultural competitiveness above
and should be employed in this study.
   The general analysis framework of this thesis can be presented shortly and
conclusively in Figure 2-1. The thesis first clarifies the meaning and perspectives of the
competitiveness definition at various levels by reviewing both empirical and theoretical
literature. It then describes the development of competitiveness theory from the absolute
comparative concept of Adam Smith to the national competitiveness model of Micheal
Porter. The different frameworks of competitiveness will be explained, discussed, and
selected for the employment in this thesis.
   In general, the trade indices such as the RCA, the RTA, the NRCA, the TCI, and the
ESI are employed to obtain the research objectives 1 and 2. The approach also partly
enhances the research objective 4. In detail, the trade performance approaches of the
RCA, the RTA, and the NRCA will be used to measure the agricultural competitiveness
of Vietnam by cross-sections and the ASEAN countries by cross-countries, this
competitiveness concept can be considered as the performance competitiveness. The
                                              58



consistency of these trade performance indices will be tested in the cases of Vietnam
and the ASEAN countries. In addition, other trade performance models of the TCI and
the ESI are employed to assess the agricultural complementarity and competition
between the ASEAN countries.
   The research objectives 3 and 4 will be achieved by the economic indicator
approach. The economic and production competitiveness indicators such as the PP, the
PCR, the SP, the DRC, and the SCB in the PAM model will be employed to measure the
comparative advantages in the alternative agricultural production systems of rice,
coconut, and pomelo in Ben Tre province. This competitiveness concept may be viewed
as the potential competitiveness. The changes or dynamics of the alternative agricultural
production systems will be analyzed to understand the sensitivities of the
competitiveness indicators based on the changes of the input factors. Moreover, the
trade performance indices are also used to measure these crops to compare the
difference between the trade performance approach and the economic approach. The
empirical results of measuring competitiveness by the trade and economic approaches in
different cases and scopes are useful and significant to critically discuss and
theoretically compare between these frameworks finally.
   The next chapter will clearly and deeply discuss and explain the methodology and
the data sources used in this dissertation.

        CHAPTER 3:         RESEARCH METHODOLOGY AND DATA
      There are two main approaches with various indices for this thesis as follows (1)
trade performance indices consisting of the RCA, the RTA, the NRCA, the TCI, the
ESI, and the dynamics assessment models; (2) the PAM indicators consisting of the
PCR, the DRC, the SCB, the NPC, the EPC, the SRP, and the sensitivity analysis. There
are various data sources for this research. The secondary data is mainly obtained from
the UN Comtrade, the FAO, the WB, Vietnam GSO, Vietnam CO, and other data
sources. The primary data is obtained from the fieldwork surveys in Ben Tre province.
3.1      The trade performance indices
3.1.1 Revealed comparative advantage (RCA)
      Balassa (1965, 1977) proposes the RCA index based on the first analysis of
comparative advantage by Liesner (1958). The idea of the index is to compare the
performance of a country in a commodity or sector with the performance of a reference
group of countries or the world by using the observed export flows or the revealed data.
The RCA index can be defined as follows:
                                             𝑋𝑖𝑗     𝑋𝑤𝑗
                                 𝑅𝐶𝐴𝑖𝑗 = {       }÷{     }
                                             𝑋𝑖      𝑋𝑤
The RCA value ranges between 0 and + ∞, and the comparative-advantage-neutral point
is the unity. If the RCA > 1, then the country i obtains a comparative advantage in sector
j. If the RCA < 1, then the country i has a comparative disadvantage in sector j. The
index reveals a higher comparative advantage, namely an index number of 1.1 will
mean that the country’s share in this commodity’s exports is 10 percent higher than its
share of the total exports. The RCA can be interpreted in three ways: dichotomous,
ordinal and cardinal (Ferto and Hubbard, 2003). In the first case, RCA is employed to
assess the existence of comparative advantage in a commodity, the second way is useful
for ranking countries or sectors, and the third interpretation is utilized to measure the
dimension of the RCA.
                                           61



   This study pays attention to not only identifying the agricultural comparative
advantage but also trying to rank the competitiveness positions of the agricultural
sectors. There are different methods to classify comparative advantage degrees.
Hinloopen and Marrewijk (2001) classify the RCA values into four groups: (a) 0 <
𝑅𝐶𝐴 ≤ 1, the country has comparative disadvantage; (b) 1 < 𝑅𝐶𝐴 ≤ 2, the country has
weak comparative advantage; (c) 2 < 𝑅𝐶𝐴 ≤ 4, the country has medium comparative
advantage; and (d) 4 < 𝑅𝐶𝐴, the country has strong comparative advantages. Shen and
Gu (2007), Han et al. (2009), and Wise (2016) follow the criteria of RCA set by the
Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO) to explain that: 𝑅𝐶𝐴 < 0.8, the country
has relative disadvantage comparative; 0.8 < 𝑅𝐶𝐴 < 1.25, the country has low
comparative advantage; 1.25 < RCA < 2.5, the country has strong comparative
advantage; and 2.5 < RCA, the country has extremely strong comparative advantage.
Wei and Chunming (2012) divide the RCA values in other way: 1 < 𝑅𝐶𝐴 ≤ 2, it is low
comparative advantage; 2 < 𝑅𝐶𝐴 ≤ 3, it is high comparative advantage, and 3 < 𝑅𝐶𝐴,
it is very high comparative advantage. This study follows the quartile method to identify
the degree of agricultural comparative advantages.
3.1.2 Relative trade advantage (RTA)
   The RTA index developed by Vollrath (1991) measures the competitive advantage
of a country in a sector. The index is calculated as the difference between the relative
export advantage (RXA), which is similar to Balassa’s RCA index, and the relative
import advantage (RMA). The Vollrath’s indices are formulated as follows:
Relative export advantage (RXA):
                                            𝑋𝑖𝑗     𝑋𝑤𝑗
                                𝑅𝑋𝐴𝑖𝑗 = {       }÷{     }

Relative import advantage (RMA):
                                           𝑀𝑖𝑗     𝑀𝑤𝑗
                               𝑅𝑀𝐴𝑖𝑗 = {       }÷{     }

                                𝑅𝑇𝐴𝑖𝑗 = 𝑅𝑋𝐴𝑖𝑗 − 𝑅𝑀𝐴𝑖𝑗
   It is noted that i presents the rest of sectors (excludes the sector j) and w indicates the
rest of countries (excludes the country i). The value of RTA is between -∞ and +∞ and
the competitive-advantage-neutral point is zero. The values of RTA may be positive in
the case of the competitive advantage and negative in the opposite situation. The RXA
shows a competitive advantage when it is greater than 1 and a competitive disadvantage
when the values are between 0 and 1. This study uses the quartile method to identify the
degree of competitive advantage as competitive disadvantage, weak competitive
advantage, medium competitive advantage, and strong competitive advantage.
   The major difference between the Balassa RCA index and the Vollrath indices is that
(i) the RXA eliminates country and product double counting; (ii) it considers all traded
goods and all countries rather than subgroups and referring to global trade intensity; (iii)
and the RTA embodies for both export and import (Havrila and Gunawardana, 2003;
Ferto and Hubbard, 2003). According to Frohberg and Hartmann (1997), Mosoma
(2004) this aspect of accounting for import is becoming increasingly important due to
the strong increase in intra-industry trade.
3.1.3 Normalized revealed comparative advantage (NRCA)
   According to Yu et al. (2009), these alternative RCA indices might improve the
RCA index in certain aspects, but none of them successfully overcome all the
shortcomings. These scholars, therefore, propose the normalized revealed comparative
advantage (NRCA) index as an alternative and improved measure of the RCA index
based on the probabilistic approach of Kunimoto (1977). The NRCA index is expressed
as the normalized forms of the level deviations in actual trade flows from their expected
levels. The idea of the NRCA index is to measure the degree of deviation of a specific
country’s actual export from its comparative-advantage-neutral level in terms of its
relative scale with respect to the world export market and thus establishes its
comparability across commodity and country (Yu et al., 2009). The country’s export of
                                                63


                                                        ̂ ij , is derived from the
commodity j at the comparative-advantage-neutral point, X
comparative-advantage-neutral point of the RCA index:
                                           𝑋̂𝑖𝑗 𝑋𝑤𝑗
                                   𝑅𝐶𝐴𝑖𝑗 =     :    =1
                                            𝑋𝑖 𝑋𝑤
       ̂ j , thus, is characterized by 𝑋𝑖 𝑋𝑤𝑗 /𝑋𝑤 . The deviation of the actual export, X ij ,
   The X
                   ̂ ij , can be stated as:
and expected ones, X
                                                          𝑋𝑖 𝑋𝑤𝑗
                              ∆𝑋𝑖𝑗 = 𝑋𝑖𝑗 − 𝑋̂𝑖𝑗 = 𝑋𝑖𝑗 −
                                                           𝑋𝑤
   After normalizing ∆X ij by the world total export, 𝑋𝑤 , the NRCA index may be
extracted by the follow formula:
                                              ∆𝑋𝑖𝑗 𝑋𝑖𝑗 𝑋𝑖 𝑋𝑤𝑗
                              𝑁𝑅𝐶𝐴𝑖𝑗 =            =   −
                                               𝑋𝑤   𝑋𝑤 𝑋𝑤 𝑋𝑤
   Yu et al. (2009) construct the NRCA index as a deviation between the expected and
actual export of a country. According to the authors, the NRCA index range from -0.25
to 0.25, with the comparative-advantage-neutral point of zero when the actual exports is
identical to the expected exports of the country. The economic interpretations of the
NRCA index are as follows: the NRCA > 0 presents the country i’s actual export of
commodity j is higher than its expected export of commodity j, the comparative-
advantage-neutral level. The NRCA < 0 indicates that the country i’s actual export of
commodity j is lower than its expected export of the commodity. The higher the NRCA
values is, the stronger the comparative advantage would be, and vice versa. Following
Yu et al. (2010), this study rescales the NRCA values to facilitate the presentation of the
results by multiplying a constant 10,000 without effecting on the result. Because
comparative advantage is a relative concept, the interpretation of the magnitude of the
NRCA is more meaningful within a comparative context in terms of the relative level of
comparative advantage. For instance, 𝑁𝑅𝐶𝐴𝑣𝑥 = 0.03 and 𝑁𝑅𝐶𝐴𝑣𝑦 = 0.09 means that the
relative strength of country v’s comparative advantage in commodity y is three times of
                                            64



its comparative advantage in commodity x. This index measures the level of deviation
of a country’s real export from its comparative-advantage-neutral degree in terms of its
relative scale with respect to the world export market and thus provides a right
indication of the underlying comparative advantage. The NRCA index is also a proper
index to access the international comparative advantage and to compare different across
sectors in a country and over a period (Sarker and Ratnasena, 2014). According to Yu et
al. (2009), the 𝑁𝑅𝐶𝐴 index has the properties that: First, the sum (and the mean value)
of a country or a commodity’s NRCA scores is constant and equals to zero theoretically,
thus the sum of positive NRCAs equals the sum of negative NRCAs for each individual
commodity or country. This means that if a country gains comparative advantage in a
sector, other countries will lose comparative advantage in that sector. In the same way,
if a country gains the comparative advantage in a product, it must lose comparative
advantage in other products. This rightly reflects the concept of comparative advantage.
Second, the NRCA index is additive in terms of both countries and commodities. This
implies that the measurement of comparative advantage under the NRCA index is
independent of the classification of the commodities and countries and the NRCA index
can be used to compare the levels of comparative advantage across countries and time
(Seleka and Kebakile, 2017). Third, the possible distribution of NRCA scores is
symmetrical, ranging from − 0.25 to + 0.25 with 0 being the neutral point. Fourth, the
NRCA, especially, is useful for both cross-sections and cross-countries comparisons.
3.1.4 Dynamics of comparative advantage indicators
   According to Hinloopen and Marrewijk (2001) and Bojnec and Ferto (2008), there
are at least two types of stability and dynamics of comparative advantage (CA)
indicators: (i) the stability of the distribution of the trade performance indices from one
period to the next; (ii) the mobility of the value of the CA indices for particular sectors
every year of the full period. This thesis, moreover, uses the trend analysis to measure
the third type of the CA dynamics: (iii) the trends of the CA values over the period and
                                                65



in the future. Following Dalum et al. (1998) and Sharma and Dietrich (2007), the first
type of the competitiveness dynamics is analyzed using OLS method presented by Hart
and Prais (1956) and first utilized by Cantwell (1989) in the context of specialization.
The regression model of competitive advantage dynamics is presented as follows:
                                 𝐶𝐴𝑡2             𝑡1
                                   𝑖𝑗 = 𝛼𝑖 + 𝛽𝑖 𝐶𝐴𝑖𝑗 + 𝜀𝑖𝑗

where, the CA represents the agricultural comparative advantage indices, t1 and t 2 are
the initial year and the final year respectively, j is the agricultural sector under study, α
is a constant, β is a regression coefficient, and εj is a residual term. The CA value at
time t 2 for the agricultural sector j is the dependent variable and tested against the
independent variable of the CA value at time t1 for the agricultural sector j. Dalum et al.
(1998) affirm that the method is one of comparing two cross-sections or cross-countries
at two points in time and there is no factor of time in the observations. In this study, it is
assumed that the regression is linear in parameters and the residual εij is normal
identically distributed (εij ~ n.i.d.(0, σ)).
   The interpretation of the regression results is as follows. The β = 1 corresponds to an
unchanged pattern of the competitiveness from t1 to t 2 . If β > 1, the country tends to be
more competitive in the groups where the initial competitiveness are strong and to be
less competitive in the groups where the initial competitiveness are weak. On the other
hand, if 0 < β < 1, sectors with initial weak competitiveness increase, while sectors with
initial strong competitiveness decrease over time. If β = 0, then there is no relation
between the CA indicators in the two periods. If β < 0, the competitiveness positions of
the agricultural sectors are reversed. In other words, those CA indicators initially below
the average value will be above the average finally, and vice versa.
   According to Dalum et al. (1998) and Cantwell (1989), another feature of the
regression analysis is to test whether the degree of competitiveness changes over time
and β > 1 is not a necessary condition for the growth in the overall specialization
                                                66



pattern. In general, the variance of the comparative advantage indicators at year 𝑡2 of
country i is denoted by (𝜎𝑖𝑡2 )2 then:
                                  (𝜎𝑖𝑡2 )2 = 𝛽𝑖 2 (𝜎𝑖𝑡1 )2 + 𝜎𝜀2
where, 𝛽𝑖 2 is the square of regression coefficient of country i, (𝜎𝑖𝑡1 )2 is the variance of
the CA indicators at year 𝑡1 of country i, and 𝜎𝜀2 is the variance of the error term. The
determination coefficient 𝑅𝑖2 is defined as:
                                   𝜎𝜀2                              1
                       𝑅𝑖2   =1−          = ( ( 𝜎𝑖
                                                  𝑡2 )2
                                                        − 𝜎𝜀
                                                            2
                                                              )(          )
                                 (𝜎𝑖𝑡2 )2                        (𝜎𝑖𝑡2 )2
combining these two above equations, we have:
                          (𝜎𝑖𝑡2 )2 − 𝜎𝜀2 = 𝛽𝑖 2 (𝜎𝑖𝑡1 )2 = 𝑅𝑖2 (𝜎𝑖𝑡2 )2
rewriting this equation to present the relationship between the variance of the two
distributions:
                                          (𝜎𝑖𝑡2 )2  𝛽𝑖 2
                                                   = 2
                                          (𝜎𝑖𝑡1 )2  𝑅𝑖
this equation can be simplified to:
                                           𝜎𝑖𝑡2   |𝛽𝑖 |
                                             𝑡1 =
                                           𝜎𝑖     |𝑅𝑖 |
where, R is the correlation coefficient from the regression model and 𝜎 2 is the variance
of the dependent variable. The dispersion of a given distribution is unchanged when β =
R. If β > R (equivalent to the increase in the dispersion), then the degree of the CA rises.
If β < R (equivalent to the decrease in the dispersion), then the degree of competitive
advantage falls.
   The asymmetric problem, however, violates the assumption of normality of the error
term in the regression analysis which makes the t-statistics unreliable. The values of the
RTA indicators are in (-∞, 0, +∞) and the NRCA indicators are in (-0.25, 0, +0.25), thus
they eliminate the asymmetric problem. However, the values of the RTA indicators are
in (0, +∞), the distribution thus violates the assumption of normality of the error term in
                                                 67



the regression analysis. Additionally, using the RCA indicator in regression analysis
gives much more weight to values above one, as compared to observations below one.
To deal with the asymmetric problem, Dalum et al. (1998) transform the RCA index
into the revealed symmetric comparative advantage index (RSCA) with the same
economic implications as follows:
                                                   𝑅𝐶𝐴 − 1
                                      𝑅𝑆𝐶𝐴 =
                                                   𝑅𝐶𝐴 + 1
   The RSCA value ranges from -1 to + 1. The RSCA index translate the values from
the intervals of RCA index (0, 1]; [1, +∞) into (-1, 0]; [0, +1). The main advantage of
this index is that it makes below the unity the same weight as changes above the unity.
   The second type of mobility and stability of the CA value for a particular agricultural
sector is assessed in two ways. First, following the empirical method utilized first by
Proudman and Redding (2000), and then used by Brasili et al (2000), Ferto (2007), this
thesis employs the one-step Markov chains to analyze the probability of transition
among four classes categorized by quartile method in term of its moving from an initial
class to other classes in one-step of moving (moving within two adjacent years) and the
persistence of stability in the initial class.
   In a second way, the thesis utilizes a mobility index to analyze the mobility degree of
the CA values. The index identifies the degree of mobility throughout the entire
distribution of the CA indicators and facilitates direct cross-sections comparisons over
the full period. The index M, following Shorrocks (1978), assesses the trace of the
transition probability matrix. This M index, thus, directly captures the relative and
medium magnitude of diagonal and off-diagonal terms, and the equation of M index can
be shown as follows:
                                                 𝑛 − 𝑡𝑟(𝑃)
                                        𝑀=
                                                   𝑛−1
where, M is Shorrocks index, n is the number of classes, P is the transition probability
matrix, and tr(P) is the trace of P. A higher value of M index states greater mobility
                                             68



while the lower value of M index shows smaller mobility of the CA value among the
classes. The zero value of M index indicates the perfect immobility.
   The thesis, moreover, uses the trend analysis to examine and predict the CA trend of
a particular agricultural sector over the full period. This tool identifies the CA gaining,
losing, or maintaining trends in an agricultural sector based on comparing the change of
the CA values over time. The time trend model is presented as follows:
                                𝐶𝐴𝑡𝑖𝑗 = 𝛼𝑖𝑗 + 𝛽𝑖𝑗 𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖𝑗𝑡
where, αij is a constant; βij is the regression coefficient showing the CA trend; t is the
time index; and εtij is a residual term. Vietnam’s CA in agricultural sector j can be
considered stable if the estimated βij is close to zero (this study uses the significance
level of 10 percent). The value of βij > 0 indicates a trend in gaining the competitive
advantage while the value of βij < 0 means a trend in losing the competitive advantage.
3.1.5 Complementarity and substitutability analysis
   The thesis employs the trade complementarity index (TCI), the export similarity
index (ESI), and the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient to investigate the
complementarity and substitutability (or competition) of the ASEAN countries in
agricultural sectors.
   Drysdale (1969) proposes the trade complementarity index. The main idea of the
index is to measure the extent to which one country’s export pattern matches another
country’s import pattern more closely than it matches the pattern of world imports. The
greater this similarity, the more likely trade between them is. The TCI can be presented
as follows:
                                   𝑛     𝑗                     𝑗
                                     𝑋𝑎  𝑀𝑤 − 𝑀𝑎  𝑀
                        𝑇𝐶𝐼𝑎𝑏   = ∑(    × 𝑗    𝑗 × 𝑏)
                                     𝑋𝑎  𝑀𝑤 − 𝑀𝑎  𝑀𝑏
                                  𝑗
         j                                                                             j
where, X a is the country a’s export of commodity j; X a is country a’s total export; Ma is
                                                                           j
the country a’s import of commodity j; Ma is country a’s total import; Mb is the country
                                             69


                                                                   j
b’s import of commodity j; Mb is country b’s total import; Mw is the world import of
commodity j; Mw is the world total import. The value of TCI greater (less) than the
unity indicates the existence of strong (weak) complementarity between the export
specialization of country a and the import specialization of country b. The TCI value of
the unity means that the export and import specializations are similar to the world
economy specialization and, therefore, the existence of comparative advantage cannot
explain the bilateral trade (Vaillant and Ons, 2002).
   Finger and Kreinin (1979) suggest the export similarity index (ESI) to measure the
degree of similarity of exports between two countries on the world market. The ESI also
explains the trade complementarity between two countries by comparing the export
patterns of the countries on the world market. The model can be defined as follows:
                                                   𝑛          𝑗   𝑗
                                                      𝑋𝑎 𝑋
                          𝐸𝑆𝐼 (𝑎𝑏, 𝑤) = 100 × {∑ min ( , 𝑏 )}
                                                      𝑋𝑎 𝑋𝑏
                                                   𝑗

where, ESI (ab, w) is the similarity degree of export patterns of country a and country b
                          j
to the world market; X a /X a is the share of commodity j in country a’s total export to the
                      j
world market; and X b /X b is the share of commodity j in country b’s total export to the
world market. This ESI value ranges from 0 to 100 and the valuation neutral point is
usually 50 in the empirical studies. If the exports of both countries to the world market
are entirely the same, this index is 100; if they are totally different, it is 0. The increase
of the ESI indicates that country a and country b are getting more substitutable or
competing, while the decrease of SI shows that these countries are becoming more
complementary over time.
   According to Jayawickrama and Thangavelu (2010) and Setyari (2015) the level of
association between trade competitiveness indices of two countries is a good tool to
measure the complementarity between the countries. The Spearman’s rank correlation
coefficient is useful to identify the degree and nature of the association between trade
                                                 70



competitiveness indicators. The Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient can be
computed by using the formula as follows:
                                             𝑛

                           𝜌𝑠 = 1 − {(6 ∑ 𝑑𝑗2 ) /𝑛(𝑛2 − 1)}
                                             𝑗

where, 𝑗 (𝑗 = 1,2, . . . , 𝑛) is agricultural sector, 𝑑𝑗 is the difference between the ranks of
the competitiveness in sector j in two countries. The 𝜌𝑠 value ranges from the negative
unity to the positive unity. A positive (negative) 𝜌𝑠 indicates that two countries are
substitutable (complementary) on the world market. The closer 𝜌𝑠 to the unity, the
stronger is the export substitutability between the two countries and vice versa. If the
two countries have the same competitiveness ranking across sectors, the difference
between rankings become zero and Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient equal one
and the countries have perfectly substitutable agricultural competitiveness structures.
The increase of 𝜌𝑠 indicates that the weaker country catches up quickly with the
stronger country due to the change in the competitiveness.
3.1.6 Consistency analysis
   The economic literature interprets the comparative advantage indices variously.
Ballance et al. (1987) stresses two interpretations of the competitiveness indices,
namely, that each index (a) supplies a commodity-specific ranking of countries by
magnitude of comparative advantage and (b) provides a demarcation between countries
enjoying a comparative advantage in a particular commodity. These indices refer to as
cardinal, ordinal, and dichotomous measures. This thesis, following Ballance et al.
(1987), Ferto and Hubbard (2003), and Seyoum (2007), test the consistency between the
competitiveness indices as cardinal, ordinal, and dichotomous measures:
   (i) Cardinal measures: the measures are to compare correlation coefficients for
alternative pairs of comparative advantage indices. Two perfectly consistent indices
would produce a correlation coefficient of the unity (positive unity for directly related
and negative unity for inversely related indices). The greater or equal 0.7 correlation
                                           71



coefficients indicate the strong consistency between the comparative advantage indices;
the correlation coefficient values ranged from 0 to 0.7 mean the weak consistency
between the comparative advantage indices whilst equal and lower zero values affirm
inconsistency (based on the statistical rules of thumb and empirical review). Pearson
correlation coefficient is used to test the consistency of comparative advantage indices
as cardinal measures.
   (ii) Ordinal measures: the measures determine if pairs of comparative advantage
indices generate a consistent ranking of commodity groups by the degree of comparative
advantages. Two perfectly consistent indices would produce a correlation coefficient of
unity. The greater or equal 0.7 correlation coefficients indicate the strong consistency
between the comparative advantage indices; the correlation coefficients values ranged
from 0 to 0.7 mean the weak consistency between the comparative advantage indices
whilst equal and lower zero values affirm inconsistency. Spearman correlation
coefficient is used to test the consistency of the comparative advantage indices as
ordinal measures.
   (iii) Dichotomous measures: these measures compare the comparative advantage
indices to establish the extent to which they are consistent in distinguishing between
groups that enjoy comparative advantage and groups that do not. Results show the share
of cases in which paired indices consistently indicate that a group has a comparative
advantage or disadvantage. Two perfectly consistent indices would produce the share of
100 per cent. The shares of higher or equal 70 per cent indicate the strong consistency
between the comparative advantage indices. The thesis calculates all matching pairs of
the comparative advantage indices over the full period.
3.1.7 The data for the trade performance indices
   There are different definitions and scopes of agricultural products in academic and
practical studies and documents. This study follows the definition of the EU (2007) and
the WTO in agricultural commodities in the Revision 3 of the Standard International
                                             72



Trade Classification (SITC Rev. 3). According to the definition in SITC Rev. 3, the
agricultural products cover the codes of 0 + 1 + 21 + 22 + 231 + 24 + 261 to 265 + 268
+ 29 + 4. The data for this study is mainly extracted from the United Nations Comtrade
(UN Comtrade) based on the SITC Rev. 3. The SITC Rev. 3 offers five levels of
commodity aggregation such as 1-digit sections down to 2-digit divisions, 3-digit
groups, 4-digit subgroups, and 5-digit items. This thesis calculates the comparative
advantage at 3-digits with 61 agricultural commodity groups over the period 1997 –
2015. This thesis will define the concept “agricultural commodity group” as the
“agricultural sector” to ease and clear the writing and interpretations. The concepts of
“sector” and “commodity” may be used indistinguishably and interchangeably to refer
an activity or a similar group of activities in this thesis. The secondary data sources are
also utilized such as, the International Trade Centre (ITC), the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO), the World Bank (WB), the General Statistics Office of Vietnam
(GSO), the Custom Office of Vietnam (CO), and other data sources.
3.2      The economic and production indicators in the PAM model
      The PAM is a quantitative framework developed by Monke and Pearson (1989) to
measure the comparative advantage of a production system, assess the impact of
government policy and market failure, and estimate the production elements. The model
consists of two accounting identities: the first identity defines the profit as the difference
between revenues and costs (rows), and the second measures the effects of divergence
(distorting policies and market failures) as the difference between observed parameters
and parameters arising from the divergence.
      The basic PAM contains two cost columns, one for tradable inputs and the other for
domestic factors. Intermediate inputs (such as fertilizer, pesticide, purchased seed,
compound feed, electricity, transportation, and fuel) are grouped into the tradable-input
and domestic factor components. This process of disaggregation of intermediate goods
or services separates intermediate costs into four categories including (i) tradable inputs,
                                             73



(ii) domestic factors, (iii) transfers (taxes or subsidies), and (iv) non-tradable inputs. The
non-tradable inputs must be further disaggregated so that ultimately all component costs
are classified as tradable inputs, domestic factors, or transfers (Table 3-1).

where, A is private revenue, B private tradable input cost, C is private domestic factor
cost, and D is private profit. E is social revenue, F social tradable input cost, G is social
domestic factor cost, and H is social profit. I is output transfer, J is input transfer, K is
factor transfer, and L is net policy transfer (I, J, K, and L are the difference between
social and private elements from market failures, distorting and efficient policies). “m”,
“c”, and “t” indicates the scenario of market failure and climate change and time data
which are used for sensitive analysis. Thereafter, the symbols will be used as these
explanations. The private and social competitiveness indicators of production systems
for this research can be presented as follows (Monke and Pearson, 1989; Beghin and
Fang, 2002; Adeoye and Oni, 2014):
3.2.1 Private profitability (PP - D)
   This index shows the competitiveness of enterprises or actors in the agricultural
production system given available technology, input and output prices, and government
policy. The term private refers to observed revenues and costs in showing actual market
prices received or paid by farmers, merchants, or processors in the agricultural system.
The private profitability of agricultural product j can be simply calculated as follows:
                                                     𝑘               𝑛
                                     𝑝                        𝑝                  𝑝
           𝑃𝑃 = 𝐷 = 𝐴 − (𝐵 + 𝐶 ) = 𝑃𝑗 − {∑              𝑎𝑗𝑖 𝑃𝑖    + ∑      𝑎𝑗𝑖 𝑃𝑖 }
                                                     𝑖=1             𝑖=𝑘+1
                                             74



where, aji (i = k+1 to n) are the coefficients for domestic resources for product j; aji (i =
                                                                   p
1 to k) are the coefficients for tradable inputs for product j. Pj is the private price of
            p
product j. Pi is the private price of input i. The D > 0 indicates that the j production
system is profitable and competitive. A higher value of D indicates stronger
competitiveness of j production system.
3.2.2 Private cost ratio (PCR)
   The ratio indicates how much the j production system can afford to pay domestic
factors while still remain competitive. The actors in the system want to earn more
profits and they may obtain the result if the private domestic factor costs are smaller
than the value-added. The actors, therefore, try to minimize the private cost ratio by
decreasing domestic factor and tradable input costs. The index is calculated by the ratio
of domestic factor costs (C) to value-added (A-B) in private prices:
                                                             𝑝
                                    𝐶     ∑𝑛𝑖=𝑘+1 𝑎𝑗𝑖 𝑃𝑖
                            𝑃𝐶𝑅 =      =
                                  𝐴 − 𝐵 𝑃𝑗𝑝 − ∑𝑘𝑖=1 𝑎𝑗𝑖 𝑃𝑖𝑝

   The elements in this formula are similar to those of the PP index. The PCR < 1
indicates that the j production system is profitable and competitive. A lower value of the
PCR indicates stronger competitiveness of j production system, and vice versa.
3.2.3 Social profitability (SP - H)
The social profits measure social efficiency or comparative advantage of a production
system as the outputs and inputs are evaluated by the social prices reflecting the scarcity
values of resources. The social profit (H) of agricultural commodity j can be simply
computed as follows:
                                                     𝑘                 𝑛
           𝑆𝑃 = 𝐻 = 𝐸 − (𝐹 + 𝐺 ) = 𝑃𝑗𝑠 − {∑              𝑎𝑗𝑖 𝑃𝑖𝑠 + ∑       𝑎𝑗𝑖 𝑃𝑖𝑠 }
                                                     𝑖=1               𝑖=𝑘+1

where, aji (i = k+1 to n) are the coefficients for domestic resources for product j; aji (i =
1 to k) are the coefficients for tradable inputs for product j. Pjs is the social price of
product j. Pi𝑠 is the social price of input i. The H > 0 indicates that the j production
                                           75



system is socially profitable and competitive. A higher value of H indicates stronger
competitiveness of j production system.
3.2.4 Domestic resource cost (DRC)
   The indicator evaluates the relative efficiency of a domestic production by
comparing the opportunity cost of the domestic production to the values added it
creates. This index is especially useful to compare the relative efficiency among
different products from a production system. The DRC can be measured by ratio of the
cost of domestic resources costs (G) to the value-added (E-F) in social prices (or the net
foreign exchange saved by domestically producing the product):
                                    𝐺     ∑𝑛𝑖=𝑘+1 𝑎𝑗𝑖 𝑃𝑖𝑠
                            𝐷𝑅𝐶 =      =
                                  𝐸 − 𝐹 𝑃𝑗𝑠 − ∑𝑘𝑖=1 𝑎𝑗𝑖 𝑃𝑖𝑠
   The presentation of the symbols in this formula is similar to the social profitability
index. The DRC < 1 means that the j production system is relatively social efficient and
competitive, and vice versa. A lower value of the DRC indicates stronger comparative
advantage of j production system. To identify the degree of competitiveness, this study
classifies the DRC values of the competitive sectors into two groups: (i) smaller and
equal to 0.5: indicate the strong comparative advantage, and; (ii) greater than 0.5 and
smaller than unity: mean the weak comparative advantage.
3.2.5 Social cost-benefit (SCB)
   Masters and Winter-Nelson (1995) argue that the DRC ratio is, however, based on
the cost of non-tradable inputs and it understates the competitiveness of activities that
use mainly such domestic factors in comparison to those that rely more on tradable
inputs. To overcome this shortcoming, the authors propose the social cost-benefit (SCB)
ratio with the same data:
                           𝐹+𝐺   ∑𝑘𝑖=1 𝑎𝑗𝑖 𝑃𝑖𝑠 + ∑𝑛𝑖=𝑘+1 𝑎𝑗𝑖 𝑃𝑖𝑠
                     𝑆𝐶𝐵 =     =
                            𝐸                   𝑃𝑗𝑠
                                           76



   The domestic production is competitive when the SCB value is less than the unity as
it reveals that total input costs are less than the revenue derived from the good. The
opposite is true for a SCB greater than the unity and the SCB of less than 0 does not
exist. To identify the degree of competitiveness, this study classifies the SCB values of
the competitive sectors into two groups: (i) smaller and equal to 0.5: indicate the strong
comparative advantage, and; (ii) greater than 0.5 and smaller than unity: mean the weak
comparative advantage.
3.2.6 Nominal protection coefficient (NPC)
   The indicator contrasts the private commodity price with a social price. This ratio
assesses the influence of distorting policies, market failures (not corrected by efficient
policy) which lead to a divergence between the two prices. The NPC on tradable outputs
(NPCO) indicates the degree of output transfer. The NPCO is measured by:
                                         𝐴 𝑃𝑗𝑃
                                   𝑁𝑃𝐶𝑂 = = 𝑠
                                         𝐸 𝑃𝑗
   If the NPCO > 1, the domestic output price is higher than the foreign output price
and the agricultural production obtains the protection from government, and vice versa.
The NPCO of 1.20 means that the policy makes the market price be a level 20 percent
higher than the world price.
   Similarly, the NPC on tradable inputs (NPCI) indicates the degree of tradable input
transfer. The NPCO is calculated as follows:
                                     𝐵 ∑𝑘𝑖=1 𝑎𝑗𝑖 𝑃𝑖𝑝
                               𝑁𝑃𝐶𝐼 = = 𝑘
                                     𝐹 ∑𝑖=1 𝑎𝑗𝑖 𝑃𝑖𝑠
   If the NPCI > 1, the domestic input price is higher than the foreign input price and
the agricultural production is taxed by government. If the NPCI < 1, the domestic input
price is lower than the foreign input price and the agricultural production is subsidized
by government. The NPCI of 0.90 shows that policies are decreasing input costs; the
average market input prices for these inputs are only 90 percent of world input prices.
                                             77



3.2.7 Effective protection coefficient (EPC)
   The EPC is the ratio of value-added at private or domestic market prices to the
value-added at the social or world market prices. The indicator merges the NPCO and
the NPCI to measure the general impact of policy (tax and subsidy) through both inputs
and outputs. The EPC is defined as:
                                                               𝑝
                                  𝐴−𝐵  𝑃𝑗𝑃 − ∑𝑘𝑖=1 𝑎𝑗𝑖 𝑃𝑖
                            𝐸𝑃𝐶 =     = 𝑠
                                  𝐸−𝐹  𝑃𝑗 − ∑𝑘𝑖=1 𝑎𝑗𝑖 𝑃𝑖𝑠
   The EPC > 1 indicates the net subsidy of the government while the EPC < 1 mean
the net disincentive of the government.
3.2.8 Profitability coefficient (PC)
   The PC is the extension of EPC to capture all factor transfers of public policy and
market failures. Thus it is the ratio of private profit to social profit. The PC measures the
incentive effects of all policies and thus serves as a proxy for the net policy transfer. The
index, however, has limitations to interpret in a case of the negative values of private or
social profits.
                                                𝑝                𝑝
                       𝐴−𝐵−𝐶  𝑃𝑗𝑃 − ∑𝑘𝑖=1 𝑎𝑗𝑖 𝑃𝑖 − ∑𝑛𝑖=𝑘+1 𝑎𝑗𝑖 𝑃𝑖
                  𝑃𝐶 =       = 𝑠
                       𝐸−𝐹−𝐺  𝑃𝑗 − ∑𝑘𝑖=1 𝑎𝑗𝑖 𝑃𝑖𝑠 − ∑𝑛𝑖=𝑘+1 𝑎𝑗𝑖 𝑃𝑖𝑠
   The PC > 1 indicates a net incentive while the PC < 1 means a net disincentive.
3.2.9 Subsidy ratio to producers (SRP)
   The subsidy ratio to producers is the final incentive indicator. The SRP is defined as
the ratio of the net policy transfer to the total social revenues (SRP = L/E). The
indicator, generally, explains the overall transfer from the society to the producer in the
case of positive SRP value and the overall transfer from the producer to the society in
the case of negative SRP value.
3.2.10 The data and estimations for the PAM indicators
   Data sources and sampling: The data for producing the PAMs and value chain
performance for the agricultural crops are yields, input quantities, input market prices,
                                           78



output market prices. Moreover, the data of transportation cost, processing cost, storage
cost, port cost, subsidies, tariffs, exchange rate, and others are needed to derive social
prices. The primary data will be collected directly in the fieldworks by structured and
semi-structured questionnaires for all actors in the value chains including 430 farmers,
50 middle traders, 20 trading & processing companies, 20 whole sales & export
companies, and 50 retailers in pomelo, coconut, and rice value chains in Ben Tre
province and related locations by convenience sampling. The most important factors of
the data for PAM analysis are the reliability and the sufficiency of the information but
not sample sizes. Thus, the authors try to collect more and more data until the necessary
information is sufficient and reliable to calculate the PAM indicators. The sampling
details are presented in Table 3-2. The experts are also interviewed for more data and
information such as government officers, logistic companies, banks, researchers, and
other supporting companies. Moreover, the actors of rice sector in Kien Giang province
are also interviewed to compare and analyze the value chain performance and the
economic indicators more precisely and practically. The secondary data is collected
from different resources such as the United Nations COMTRADE data, the World
Bank, the Food and Agricultural Organization, the International Trade Center, the
Vietnamese National and Local General Statistics Offices, the General Department of
Vietnam Customs, the Vietnam State Bank, and other reports and news articles.
   Real exchange rate estimation: The real exchange rate is a key ratio to transfer the
private revenue into the social revenue. According to Bui et al. (2017), Vietnam real
exchange rate has been significantly overvalued recently, most notably due to Vietnam’s
relatively high inflation rate. Mai (2007), based on IMF data, shows that the real
exchange rate is relatively higher than the nominal official exchange rate over the time.
The IMF (2016) and Darvas (2012) indicate that the real effective exchange rate of
Vietnam increases over time in comparison with the index in 2010. This study uses the
data of consumer price indices (CPI) of Vietnam and the USA from FAOSTAT and the
                                              79



data of the official exchange rate from WB to estimate the real exchange rate with the
reference of Mai (2007), IMF (2016), and Bui et al. (2017). The result shows that, in
2016, the ratio of Vietnam’s CPI to the USA’s CPI is 1.36. The official exchange rate of
Vietnam in 2016 is 21,935 VND per USD. As the result, the Vietnam’s real exchange
rate is 29,815 VND per USD. This means that Vietnam undervalues the exchange rate
or overvalues the local currency of VND.

   Tradable inputs and domestic factors: According to Monke and Pearson (1989), the
dividing all input costs into the domestic factor and tradable-input is a difficult work.
Moreover, the tradable inputs (and domestic factors) should be also further
disaggregated so that ultimately all component costs are classified as tradable inputs,
domestic factors, or transfers. The adjustment, however, has a trivial effect on the
results. They additionally explain the rule of thumb that unless the non-tradable input
                                            80



accounts for more than some percent of total production costs, separate budgeting
exercises can be avoided. Yao (1997b) divides tradable input cost (such as imported
fertilizers) into 80 percent of tradable input and 20 percent of non-tradable input.
However, most of the empirical studies do not separate the tradable input cost and
completely define an input as tradable inputs and domestic factors. Bruno (1972)
stresses that if inputs are domestic but tradable they could in principle be classified into
either one or the other. If the evaluation is made at opportunity cost, it would make no
difference for the decision criterion. Following Yao (1997b), this study separates the
tradable input cost into detail tradable inputs and domestic factors with the principals:
(i) the service and logistic cost are relatively higher in Vietnam than Thailand; (ii) the
local goods and service cost (such as electricity, water, and seed) are also divided into
detail domestic factors and tradable inputs; and (iii) the proportions of tradable inputs
and domestic factors of various crops are different and dependent on the origin and
characteristics of the inputs. Specifically, though seed (purchased), chemical pesticide,
chemical fertilizer, and fuel are the tradable inputs, they consist of various domestic
costs such as port charge, unloading, transporting, warehouse, and markup and the
domestic products obtain significant market shares. Electricity, water, and contracted
services are domestic factors they, however, employ some tradable goods such as pipe,
pump, wire, machines, and equipment. Pomelo and coconut need to have the initial
investments and the farmers have no income in the period. The cost, therefore, will be
accounted as the depreciation for harvesting period. The initial investment costs also
include both tradable inputs and domestic factors. The details of the tradable inputs and
domestic factors are presented in the Appendices 17, 18, and 19.
   Social prices for outputs and tradable inputs: The social prices for output and
tradable inputs are, in general, measured as border prices (export/import parity prices)
and adjusted to the farm level (Gorton et al, 2000). Based on the approach of Yao
(1997b), the social input cost will be calculated from the private input cost which
                                            81



includes the private tradable input cost and the private domestic factors. The private
tradable input cost is transferred to the social tradable input cost by excluding
divergence (tax) and multiplying with the real exchange rate. The social domestic
factors are equal to the private domestic factors. The private input price (cost) data is
collected and calculated at the farm gate from farmers, retailers, and public information.
   Social prices for the agricultural outputs in this research (rice, coconut, and pomelo)
will be computed as export parity prices (F.O.B) and adjusted to the farm gate level
since rice, coconut, and pomelo are all export agricultural products of Vietnam. The
adjustment of prices from border to farm gate takes account of port and handling
charges, transport, storage, packaging, production, primary processing, and markup. The
material coconut nut is mainly processed and divided into coconut fiber, coconut peat,
coconut cell coal, desiccated coconut, and coconut jelly with various production
processes and technology. Thus the parity price of coconut nut will be aggregated from
the parity prices of these various coconut products and materials based on the primary
processing coefficients. The paddy rice and bran are processed from paddy grain with
milling and polishing as processing. Thus the parity price of paddy grain will be
aggregated from the parity prices of these various paddy grain products and materials
(paddy rice and bran) based on the primary processing coefficients. Moreover, the farm
gate parity price of export rice type of IR504 will be transferred into the farm gate parity
price of rice type of OC10 produced in Ben Tre based on the price rate of IR504 and
OC10 paddy grain and paddy rice in the local market. The pomelo is fresh fruit and is
not processed into other products with polishing and cleaning as processing. The social
price for the outputs is transferred from the private price by excluding divergence (tax)
and multiplying with the real exchange rate.
   Land opportunity cost: The practitioners usually calculate the land opportunity cost
by the sum of market rent and state land charge. According to Yao (1997b), a more
precise way to compute the land opportunity cost for a crop is the best net return to the
                                            82



land (per hectare) of the strongest competitive crops. The net profits of rice, coconut,
and pomelo will be compared. The net return of the most profitable crop will be adopted
as the land opportunity cost for other crops and the net return of the second best
profitable crop is the land opportunity cost for the first one. This way, however, does not
take account of land transforming cost to cultivate a new crop (changing a crop to other
new crops). In this study, both methods are used to calculate and compare the results
   Labor opportunity cost: The social cost of labor is based on the formula of Yao
(1997b). It is simply calculated as the weighted average of the peak-season and off-peak
season wage rates. However, the private prices, the weights, and the high and low
seasons of the labors in the sectors of rice, coconut, and pomelo are relatively different.
The weight is 50 percent and the wage is VND 250 thousand in the peak-season of rice.
The weight is 70 percent and the wage is VND 200 thousand in the peak-season of
coconut and pomelo. The authors assume that the wage is VND 70 thousand in the off-
season for all sectors.
   Productivity: The productivities of rice, coconut, and pomelo are important
indicators to identify the comparative advantage of these sectors. The primary data of
productivity is collected from the farmers. However, the primary production and
productivity data of farmers are extremely different and not perfectly representative.
This study, therefore, adjust the productivity indicators of rice, coconut, and pomelo
based on the secondary data from Ben Tre statistics office. Moreover, to eliminate the
impact of unusual events, the authors consult the average values of seven years over the
period 2010-2016. The production and productivity values will be calculated per hectare
for one year to compare the comparative advantages between the three agricultural
production systems. In this research, it is assumed that Ben Tre rice sector may be
harvested two times per year per farm in average while coconut and pomelo are fruit
crops and harvested in the aggregate per farm per year.

3.2.11 Sensitivity analysis of the PAM indicators
   The PAM is a static framework and it may not take account of the potential changes
in the input and output variables such as input prices, output prices, and productivity.
The dynamic comparative advantages of the agricultural sectors are dependent on the
changes in the market and production conditions. In other words, the sensitive analysis
presents how the PAM indicators for the agricultural production systems react to
different variable changes and how the agricultural sectors can enhance the comparative
advantages improving the variables. Yao (1997a, b) assesses the sensitivity on the
comparative advantages of soybeans, rice, and mungbean production systems in
Thailand with the changes in export and import prices of inputs and outputs, water
charges, labor cost, fertilizer costs, and environmental cost or benefit. Nguyen and
Heidhues (2005) and Mane-Kapaj et al. (2010) employ the changes of parameters (for
example: by ±5, ±10, ±15, and ±20 percent) for various variables consisting of
productivity, export price, shadow exchange rate, imported fertilizer prices, social labor
costs, and the market land rent. Nguyen and Heidhues (2005), moreover, measure the
fluctuations of the comparative advantages with the changes determining factors
simultaneously. Gorton et al. (2006) project the comparative advantages of Hungarian
agriculture under three policy scenarios: (a) baseline (non-accession into EU), (b)
accession into EU with historical levels of productivity growth and (c) accession with
productivity convergence. Bernal et al. (2012) estimate the comparative advantages of
the agriculture in Mexico under the unsustainable scenarios of environmental
degradation from the overuse of irrigation water which makes the agricultural
productivity decrease by 2 percent.
   In this study, the authors measure the sensitivity of the PAM indicators by three
scenarios: (i) Climate change: The drought and salinity intrusion in the Mekong Delta of
Vietnam in 2016, this problem makes rice yield decrease by 14 percent, pomelo yield
decrease by 5 percent while it causes the 1 percent increase of coconut yield in
                                           84



comparison with 2015 (Ben Tre Statistics Office, 2017); (ii) Water and land charges:
The government takes the full charges of water and land (without subsidy); (iii) The
parameters of the PAM variables and elements such as output prices, input prices,
production productivity, and the real effective exchange rate by the assuming scope of
±5, ±10, ±15 and ±20 percent. The study, moreover, tries to identify the neutral points
of the PAM indicators with the changes of the variables, namely the domestic resource
cost and the private cost ratios are equal to the unity; the private profitability and the
social profitability are equal to zero.

        CHAPTER 4:           VIETNAM’S AGRICULTURAL TRADE
     COMPETITIVENESS: THE CROSS-SECTIONS ANALYSIS
   This chapter measures the static agricultural competitiveness of Vietnam by the
RCA, the RTA, and the NRCA. The dynamics of the indicators are assessed in three
ways: OLS regression, Markov matrices, and trend analysis. The paper, moreover, tests
the consistency between the RCA, NRCA, and RTA indices by cross-section. The
results show that (i) Vietnam, generally, achieves strong competitiveness in crop and
fishery sectors whilst it has weak competitiveness in livestock and processed food
sectors; (ii) the country has the convergent pattern of agricultural competitiveness with
the high stability of strong competitive and uncompetitive sectors; (iii) the country’s
agricultural export strategy and competitiveness pattern are based on the natural-
resource-intensive and traditional agricultural products with a slight improvement over
time; and (iv) the RCA, NRCA, and RTA indices are strongly consistent in identifying
the degrees of competitiveness and determining whether a country obtains
competitiveness while they are weakly consistent in ranking competitiveness.
4.1 Vietnam’s agricultural trade competitiveness by the RCA
4.1.1 Measuring the static competitiveness
   The analysis result at 3-digits level in Table 4-1 shows that, in 2014, Vietnam
obtains the strongest comparative advantage in wood in chips; spices; rice; natural
rubber, coffee,coffee substitute, crustaceans,molluscs etc, and fish etc.prepd,prsvd.nes
with the RCA values of 18.41, 17.57, 14.00, 12.52, 11.31, 9.54, and 8.92, respectively.
The world market share in 2014 also indicates the similar result for the top competitive
sectors. The country has the weakest competitiveness in cork, natural, raw, waste;
furskins, raw; barley, unmilled; wool, other animal hair; butter, other fat of milk. There
are relative differences between the comparative advantage indicators in 1997 and 2014.
   Based on the classification of the RCA values in Table 4-4, the country has four
strong competitive agricultural sectors, four medium competitive agricultural sectors,
                                           86



and 11 weak competitive agricultural sectors. Vietnam achieves the competitiveness in
19 agricultural sectors in 2014, while it has the competitiveness in 23 sectors in the
average of the period. The average analysis of comparative advantage for the full period
1997 - 2014 shows that rice is the strongest comparative advantage commodity with the
value of 37.83. The next top highly competitive groups in the full period are crustaceans
and molluscs; spices; natural rubber; coffee; wood in chips. There are significant
variations between the RCA values in 2014 and in the average of the full period. This
indicates a mobility and change of the RCA values over time.

    Vietnam, generally, has strong comparative advantages in the crop sectors such as
spices, rice, coffee, tea, fruit & nut, and vegetables; and the fishery sectors such as
crustaceans and fish whilst the country is definitely comparative disadvantageous in the
livestock sectors such as live animal, meat, and eggs & birds; and the processed food
sectors such as chocolate, cheese, butter, and other processed meat & foods.
4.1.2 Analyzing the dynamics of the competitiveness indicators
The changes of the RCA indicators between 1997 and 2014
    The difference of the RCA values between 1997 and 2014 shows Vietnam’s change
in comparative advantage. There are 22 competitive sectors in 1997 and only 19
competitive sectors in 2014. The country experiences the increase of the comparative
advantage in 29 agricultural commodity sectors and the decrease of the comparative
advantage in 29 agricultural commodity sectors. The top increasing sectors are wood in
chips; fish, fresh, chilled, frozen; and fish, prepared, preserved. The top decreasing
sectors are rice; crustaceans, molluscs; and tea and mate. Eggs, birds, yolks, albumin;
crude animal materials; and silk, especially, move from strong advantage comparative
groups to disadvantage comparative sectors (Table 4-2).

The general pattern of the RSCA indicators by the OLS method
    The estimation results for the RSCA indicators result in the values of 0 < β < 1 and
values of β/R < 1 over three periods (Table 4-3) (the RSCA is the replace for the RCA
for regression without changing economic implications). The results indicate that
Vietnam, in general, has the convergent pattern in the agricultural competitiveness. In
other words, the country loses the competitiveness in the initial strong competitive
                                             88



agricultural sectors whilst it gains the competitiveness in the initial weak competitive
agricultural sectors. The values of 0 < β < 1 also prove the process of de-specialization
in Vietnam’s agricultural export competitiveness. The possible explanation for the result
is that: Vietnam’s agricultural competitiveness pattern is based on natural resources with
the primary agricultural products, thus the country’s increases in the productions and
exports of the strong competitive sectors will result in the utilization of higher
opportunity cost resources. Therefore, the competitive advantages of these sectors
decrease. On the other hand, the resources of the new and weak competitive advantage
sectors are still abundant with lower opportunity cost resources. Therefore, the
competitive advantages of these sectors increase. This result is consistent with the
traditional economic theory which explains that a country tends to decrease the
competitive advantage in a commodity when it increases the production specialization
and exports the product to the world market.

The mobility and stability of the RCA indicators by Markov matrix
   The RCA values are classified into four groups including competitive disadvantage,
weak competitive advantage, medium competitive advantage, and strong competitive
advantage. The boundary of competitive and uncompetitive groups is remained (the
RCA neutral value is the unity) and the authors then divide the RCA values into 3
classes of weak, medium and strong advantages by quartile method (Table 4-4). Let pij
(i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4) denotes a one-step transition probability, that is the transition
probability for the agricultural sectors which are in class “i” of year “t” moving to class
“j” of year “t+1”.
   The stability and mobility of the RCA indicators are investigated by using Markov
transition probability matrix and mobility index for yearly values of the RCA values
                                            89



from 1997 to 2014. The diagonal elements of Markov matrix show the probability of
remaining persistently in the initial class. The other elements of Markov transition
probability matrix provide further information on the mobility of the RCA values.
Specifically, they show the probabilities of moving from one class to another from the
year “t” to the year “t+1”. There is a 4x4 matrix with 1,037 observations.

   The result indicates that the high probabilities of the RCA indicators remain in their
initial class (high diagonal elements) in which the uncompetitive sectors with 94.89
percent and the strong competitive sectors with 95.51 percent maintain the highest
probabilities and they are the most persistent. In other words, the sectors with initial
non-competitiveness seem to stay uncompetitive whilst the sectors with initial strong
competitiveness maintain to be competitive. The average probability of stability in
initial class is 85.49 percent whilst the average probability of mobility to other class is
4.84 percent. There is no sector moving from class 4 backwards to class 1 and class 2,
and from class 2 forward class 4. The probabilities of closer shifts are higher than the
probabilities of longer moves between classes. M-Shorrocks of 0.19, generally, shows a
relatively low degree of mobility between the classes in Markov matrix (Table 4-5).

   The total and the long run distributions are relatively similar and this indicates that
the Markov matrix accurately captures the underlying distribution of the RCA indicators
(Hinloopen and Marrewijk, 2001). The difference between total and long run
probabilities, moreover, indicates that the shares of uncompetitive sectors increase
whilst the competitive sectors decline.
The trends of the RCA indicators
   The result of trend analysis for the RCA indicators during the period of 1997–2014
shows that Vietnam has the gaining trends in 19 agricultural commodity sectors with β
> 0 and the country incurs the losing trends in 23 agricultural commodity sectors with β
< 0. The wood in chips, particles; fish etc., prepared, preserved; fish, fresh, chilled,
frozen; vegetable textile fibres; and animal oils and fats exhibit the most growing trend
in the revealed comparative advantage. This suggests that Vietnam continues to obtain
the stronger comparative advantage in these commodities during this period and in the
future. During the same period, rice; crustaceans, molluscs etc; fuel wood, wood
charcoal; natural rubber; and coffee, coffee substitute exhibit the most losing trend in
the revealed comparative advantage (Table 4-6).

4.2 Vietnam’s agricultural trade competitiveness by the RTA
4.2.1 Measuring the static competitiveness
   The analysis result of agricultural relative trade advantage at 3-digits level shows
that, in 2014, Vietnam obtains the strongest competitiveness in wood in chips; spices;
rice; natural rubber; and coffee,coffee substitute, coffee,coffee substitute, and fish
etc.prepd,prsvd.nes with the RTA values of 21.79, 19.27, 15.85, 13.02, 12.47, 12.47,
and 9.64, respectively, while the country has the weakest competitiveness in wood,
simply worked; crude animal materls.nes; animal feed stuff; maize unmilled; and cotton.
The world market share indicator in 2014 also indicates the similar results for the top
competitive agricultural sectors (Table 4-7).
   Vietnam, in 2014, achieves the competitive advantages in 27 agricultural sectors.
Based on the classification of the RTA values into four groups by quartile method
(Table 4-10), the country has seven strong competitive advantage agricultural sectors,
four medium competitive advantage agricultural sectors, and 16 weak competitive
advantage agricultural sectors.
   Vietnam, generally, has strong competitive advantages in crop sectors such as spices,
rice, coffee, tea, fruit & nut, and vegetables; and fishery sectors such as crustaceans and
fish whilst the country is definitely competitive disadvantageous in livestock sectors
such as live animal, meat, and eggs & birds; and processed food sectors such as
chocolate, cheese, butter, and other processed meat & foods (Table 4-7).
   The average values of the RTA indicators for the full period 1997 - 2014 show that
Vietnam obtains 28 competitive advantage sectors and rice is the strongest competitive
advantages sector with the value of 44.99. The next highly competitive sectors in period
average are crustaceans and molluscs; spices; coffee,coffee substitute; and natural
rubber, and wood in chips with the values of 25.72, 19.73, 18.90, 18.70, and 12.03
respectively. There are significant variations between the RTA values in 2014, in 1997
and in the period average.

4.2.2 Analyzing the dynamics of the RTA indicators
The changes of the RTA indicators between 1997 and 2014
      The variation of the RTA values between 1997 and 2014 shows Vietnam’s changes
in positions of competitive advantages. There are 33 competitive agricultural sectors in
1997 and only 27 competitive agricultural sectors in 2014. The country obtains the
increase of the competitive advantages in 22 agricultural sectors but losses the decrease
of the competitive advantages in 39 agricultural sectors.
                                                     93



     The top increasing agricultural sectors are wood in chips; meal, flour of wheat; and
 fish etc. prepared, preserved. The top decreasing agricultural sectors are rice;
 crustaceans, molluscs; and cotton. Notably, crude animal material; eggs, birds, yolks;
 jute, other textile bast fibres; oil-seeds, soft fixed vegetable oils; and edible products and
 preparations move from strong competitive advantages class to competitive
 disadvantages class (Table 4-8).

 The general pattern of the RTA indicators by the OLS method
     The estimation for the RTA indicators over three periods results in the values of 0 <
 β < 1 and values of β/R < 1 (Table 4-9). The results indicate that Vietnam, in general,
 has the convergent pattern in the agricultural competitiveness by the RTA. In other
 words, the country loses the competitiveness in the initial strong competitive
 agricultural sectors whilst it gains the competitive advantage in the initial weak
 competitive agricultural sectors. The values of 0 < β < 1 also prove the process of de-
 specialization in Vietnam’s agricultural export competitiveness. This result and the
 possible explanation for the result are similar to those of the RSCA (or RCA).

 The mobility and stability of the RTA indicators by Markov matrix
     The RTA values are classified into four groups including competitive disadvantage,
 weak competitive advantage, medium competitive advantage, and strong competitive
                                             94



advantage. The boundary of competitive and uncompetitive groups is remained (the
RTA neutral value is 0) and the authors then divide the RTA values into 3 classes of
weak, medium and strong advantages by quartile method (Table 4-10). Let 𝑝𝑖𝑗 (i, j = 1,
2, 3, 4) denotes a one-step transition probability, that is the transition probability for the
agricultural sectors which are in class “i” of year “t” moving to class “j” of year “t+1”.
   The stability and mobility of the RTA values are investigated by using the Markov
transition probability matrix and mobility index for yearly values of the RTA indicators
from 1997 to 2014. The diagonal elements of the Markov matrix show the probability of
remaining persistently in the initial class. The other elements of the Markov transition
probability matrix provide further information on the mobility of the RTA values.
Specifically, they show the probabilities of moving from one class to another from the
year “t” to the year “t+1”. There is a 4x4 matrix with 1,037 observations.
      Table 4-10: The classification of the RTA values and the interpretations
      Categories                       Interpretation               RTA values
       Class 1                Non-competitiveness                    ≤0
       Class 2                Weak competitiveness                   ≤ 1.41
       Class 3                Medium competitiveness                 ≤ 7.48
       Class 4                Strong competitiveness                 > 7.48
Source: Own calculation based on the data of UN Comtrade (2017)
   The result indicates that the high probabilities of the RTA values remain in their
initial class (high diagonal elements) in which the uncompetitive sectors (in class 1) and
the strongly competitive sectors (in class 4) maintain the highest probabilities and the
most persistent. In other words, the groups with initial non-competitiveness seem to stay
uncompetitive whilst the groups with initial strong competitiveness maintain to be
strongly competitive. The average probability of stability in initial class is 84.07 percent
whilst the average probability of mobility to other classes is only 5.31 percent. There is
no sector moving from class 4 backwards class 1 and class 2, and from class 2 forward
class 4. The probabilities of closer moves are higher than the probabilities of longer
                                            95



moves between classes. M-Shorrocks of 0.21, generally, presents a relatively low degree
of mobility between classes in the matrix (Table 4-11).
   Table 4-11 also presents total probability (empirical ergodic) distribution and long
run probability (implied ergodic) distribution. The total run and the long run
distributions are relatively similar and this means that the Markov matrix accurately
captures the underlying distribution of the RTA indicators (Hinloopen and Marrewijk,
2001). The difference between total run and long run probabilities confirms that the
shares of uncompetitive and weak competitive sectors increase whilst the medium and
strong competitive sectors decline in the long future.

The trends of the RTA indicators
   The result of the RTA indicator trend analysis during the period of 1997–2014
shows that Vietnam has the RTA gaining trends in 12 agricultural sectors with β > 0
whilst the country incurs the RTA losing trends in 28 agricultural sectors with β < 0.
Vietnam achieves the most RTA growing trends in wood in chips; meal, flour of wheat;
fish.prepared, preserved; vegetable textile fibres; and fish, fresh, chilled, frozen during
this period. This suggests that the country continues to obtain the stronger competitive
advantage in these agricultural sectors in the future. During the same period, Vietnam
has the most RTA losing trends in rice; crustaceans, molluscs; coffee, coffee substitute;
natural rubber; and tea and mate. The country will continue to incur the weaker
competitive advantage in these agricultural sectors in the future (Table 4-12).

4.3 Vietnam’s agricultural trade competitiveness by the NRCA
4.3.1 Measuring the static competitiveness
   The result in Table 4-13 shows that, in 2014, Vietnam obtains 19 competitive sectors
with the strongest competitive advantages in coffee,coffee substitute; rice;
crustaceans,molluscs; fish,fresh,chilled,frozen, and fish etc.prepd,prsvd; fruit,nuts
excl.oil nuts; natural rubber, etc. with the NRCA values of 1.76, 1.48, 1.45, 1.18, 0.96,
0.94, 0.83, respectively, while alcoholic beverages; other meat, meat offal; oilseed are
the weakest competitive sectors with the NRCA values of -0.34, -0.31, -0.26,
respectively. The results in 2014 are slightly different to those in 1997 and in the
average values of 1997-2014. There are 22 competitive sectors in 1997 and in the
average with the strongest competitiveness in rice in 1997 and in crustaceans,molluscs.
   Based on the classification the NRCA values into four classes by quartile method
(Table 4-16), Vietnam, in 2014, has nine strong competitive sectors (NRCA values >
0.48), two medium competitive sectors (0.48 ≥ NRCA values > 0.07), and eight weak
                                             97



competitive sectors (0.07 ≥ NRCA values > 0). These results, in general, are different to
those of the RCA and the RTA indices.

      Vietnam, in overall, obtains strong comparative advantages in fishery sectors such as
fish and crustaceans; and crop sectors such as rice, coffee, tea, spices, fruit & nuts, and
vegetables whilst it has comparative disadvantage in livestock sectors such as live

4.3.2 Analyzing the dynamics of of the NRCA indicators
The changes of the NRCA indicators between 1997 and 2014
    There are significant changes of the NRCA values between 1997 and 2014. Vietnam
achieves the growing competitiveness in 17 sectors while it incurs the losing
competitiveness in 44 sectors. The top competitiveness increasing sectors are
fish,fresh,chilled,frozn; coffee,coffee substitute; fruit,nuts excl.oil nuts, while the top
competitiveness decreasing sectors oilseed; other meat,meat offal; edible prod.preprtns.
There are three agricultural sectors reversely moving up and five agricultural sectors
reversely moving down. (Table 4-14).

The general pattern of the NRCA indicators by the OLS method
    The regression results for the NRCA dynamics in three periods 1997-2005, 2006-
2014, and 1997-2014 bring in the values of  > 1 and /R > 1. These results satisfy both
necessary and sufficient conditions to confirm that Vietnam has the increase in the
overall specialization trade pattern. In other words, the result explains that Vietnam
gains the increasing competitiveness in the initial strong competitive sectors whilst it
loses the competitiveness in the initial weak competitive sectors. The agricultural
competitiveness pattern of the country, thus, has a divergent pattern over all periods
(Table 4-15). This result of the NRCA is different to those of the RCA and the RTA.
The mobility and stability of the NRCA indicators by Markov matrix
                                            99



   The stability and mobility analysis of the NRCA indicators by Markov transition
probability matrix requires the classifications of the competitiveness values. This study
employs quartile method to group the NRCA values of 1,037 observations in 18 years
into four classes (Table 4-16). The neutral point value of zero is remained in class 1; the
class 2 includes the values from zero to quartile 2; the class 3 is from quartile 2 to
quartile 3; and the class 4 is higher than quartile 3. Let 𝑝𝑖𝑗 (i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4) denotes a
one-step transition probability. It is, specifically, the transition or mobility probability
for a commodity to move from the class i of year t to the class j of year (t +1).

   The diagonal elements of the matrix indicate the stability of sectors persistently
remaining in their initial classes. The result shows high stabilities in the NRCA
indicators over time. The sectors in class 1 and class 4 obtain the highest probabilities of
stabilities (97.56 and 100 percent). In other words, this result confirms that the initial
weakest competitive agricultural sectors steadily continue to stay in their ranks over the
                                             100



period and the strongest competitive agricultural sectors perfectly remain in their initial
positions. The off-diagonal terms of the matrix, namely the probability of moving from
one class to another from the year “t” to the year “t+1”, provides further information on
the mobility of the NRCA values. The strong competitiveness sectors (class 4) perfectly
persist in their initial class. No agricultural sector moves from class 4 backwards class 1,
2 and 3 as well as from class 1, 2 forward class 4. Another finding is that the movements
from stronger classes back to weaker classes have greater probability than from the
weaker classes to the stronger classes (Table 4-17). The average probability of stability
or diagonal elements is 87.04 whilst the average value of mobility or off-diagonal
elements is only 4.32 percent. M-Shorrocks index of 0.17 confirms a low degree of
mobility of the NRCA indicators. The total probability result shows that there is the
highest probability of the NRCA values moving to class 1 with 66.35 percent and the
lowest probability of the NRCA values moving to class 3 with 8.2 percent (Table 4-17).

The trends of the NRCA indicators
   The trend analysis result of the NRCA values over the period 1997-2014 illustrates
that Vietnam obtains the gaining trends in 14 agricultural sectors with β > 0 and the
                                            101



country has the losing trends in 37 agricultural sectors with β < 0. The country has the
most increasing comparative advantages in fish,fresh,chilled,frozn; natural rubber;
coffee, coffee substitute; fish etc.prepd,prsvd.nes; and fruit,nuts excl.oil nuts. The result
also helps to predict that Vietnam might continue to obtain the stronger comparative
advantage in these sectors during this period and in the future. Conversely, Vietnam has
the most decreasing comparative advantages in oil-seeds; other meat,meat offal; milk
and cream; fixed veg.fat,oils,other; and alcoholic beverages and these sectors could
continue to lose their comparative advantages in the future (Table 4-18).
4.4 The consistencies of the trade performance indices: sector-ranking
   The sector-ranking consistency tests for the RCA, RTA, and NRCA indices as
cardinal, ordinal and dichotomous measures indicate the general differences and
similarities of these indicators in assessing the competitiveness. The result, generally,
shows in Table 4-19 that these indices are strongly consistent as cardinal and
dichotomous measures while they are averagely consistent as ordinal measures. This
means that the counting both export and import data in the RTA may not significantly
impact on identifying the degrees of the agricultural competitiveness and determining
whether a country obtains the competitiveness in an agricultural sector while the
counting may relatively change the competitiveness rankings of the agricultural sectors.
   Specifically, as cardinal measures, the correlation coefficients of the RCA & the
RTA, the RCA & the NRCA, the RTA & the NRCA are relatively high with the average
coefficient values of 0.96, 0.86, and 0.83, respectively. This means that the RCA & the
RTA are extremely consistent as cardinal measures and the RCA & the NRCA, the RTA
& the NRCA are strongly consistent as cardinal measures to identify and explain the
degrees and structures of the agricultural competitiveness. The strongest consistencies
are between the RCA & the RTA in 1997, 2000, and 2002 with the coefficient values of
more than 0.98. As ordinal measures, the correlation coefficients of the RCA & the
RTA, the RTA & the NRCA are low while the correlation coefficient of the RCA & the
                                            102



NRCA is relatively high with the mean coefficient values of 0.65, 0.66, and 0.75,
respectively. This means that the RCA & the NRCA are strongly consistent while the
RTA & the RCA, the RTA & the NRCA are weakly consistent as ordinal measures to
rank and explain the positions and structures of the agricultural competitiveness. The
weakest consistencies are between the RCA & the RTA in 2003 and 2006 with the
coefficient values of 0.60 and 0.57. As dichotomous measures, the RCA & the NRCA
are perfectly consistent with the matching shares of 1 due to the derivation of the NRCA
from the neutral-point of the RCA. The consistencies between the RTA & the RCA, the
RTA & the NRCA are relatively strong and similar with the same matching shares in all
years. This means that the RCA & the NRCA are perfectly consistent and the RTA &
the RCA, the RTA & the NRCA are strongly consistent as dichotomous measures to
determine whether a country has competitiveness in an agricultural sector and explain
that competitiveness structures.

    CHAPTER 5:           THE ASEAN COUNTRIES’ AGRICULTURAL
     TRADE PATTERNS: THE CROSS-COUNTRIES ANALYSIS
   In order to understand the agricultural trade competitiveness pattern of Vietnam in
comparison with regional countries under the context of the global economic
integration, this chapter assesses the static agricultural competitiveness patterns of the
ASEAN countries by employing the RCA, the RTA, and the NRCA indices over the
period 1997-2015. The consistency between these indices is also tested by cross-
countries in the case of the ASEAN countries. OLS method and Markov matrix are used
to analyze the dynamics of the competitiveness indicators over time. In order to
understand whether these countries are complementary or competing in the global
agricultural market, this section then investigate the agricultural trade complementarity
the ASEAN countries on the global agricultural market over the period 1997-2015 by
employing the TCI, the ESI, and Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients for
competitiveness indicators.
   The results, generally, show that: (i) the ASEAN countries achieve the strongest
competitiveness in crop sectors, wood sectors, and fishery sectors such as rice, natural
rubber, spices, fixed vegetable fats and oils, wood in chips, fuel wood, fish, and
crustaceans. Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia are the strongest agricultural competitive
countries whilst Brunei, Singapore, and Cambodia are the weakest agricultural
competitive countries; (ii) the countries have the convergent patterns in agricultural
competitiveness except for Indonesia, Cambodia, and Brunei; and (iii) they successfully
maintain the rankings of the strong agricultural competitive sectors with the high
probabilities of these sectors to stay persistently in their initial class. The
competitiveness indices are strongly consistent as cardinal and dichotomous measures
whilst they are weakly consistent as ordinal measures; (iv) the ASEAN countries’
agricultural export patterns are weakly complementary in matching the regional import
demands; while (v) they are relatively complementary in exporting agricultural products
                                          104



to the world market; (vi) the countries’ agricultural competitiveness patterns are more
affected by and benefited from the global integration than the regional integration; and
(vii) the countries, moreover, tend to become more substitutable over time. The results
suggest that the ASEAN countries should cooperate and utilize the internal markets to
enhance the competitiveness and predominantly focus on the external markets.
   In conclusion, though Vietnam has relatively strong competitiveness in agriculture it
is facing hard competitions from the regional countries such as Thailand and Indonesia
in both domestic and global markets. These competitions or substitutability in
agriculture seem to be increase over time. Therefore, the country should utilize its
strong competitive agricultural commodities such as wood in chips, spices, rice, natural
rubber, coffee, crustaceans, and fish to develop its market shares in the local and
regional markets. Moreover, Vietnam needs to enhance and take advantage of the
international economic relationships such as APEC, WTO, TPP-CPTPP, the ASEAN’s
relationships with India, Australia, China and bilateral trade agreements with United
States, Japan, Chile, Korea, Eurasian Economic Union, and European Communities to
expand its market shares on the world markets.
5.1 The agricultural international trade performance of ASEAN countries
5.1.1 Agricultural competitiveness by the RCA
   In general, the ASEAN member countries have become more competitive in
agricultural sectors exporting to world markets over the regional economic integration
process with a growing number of competitive agricultural sectors (RCA > 1), namely,
86 competitive sectors in 1997 in comparison with 99 competitive sectors in 2015.
Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand obtain more number of
agricultural competitive sectors while Singapore and Vietnam decrease the number of
competitive sectors. Brunei, especially, does not have comparative advantage in any
agricultural sectors. On the average of the period, Vietnam is the most competitive in
agriculture with 23 competitive sectors (accounting for 38 percent), followed by
                                                    105



Indonesia and Thailand with 20 (accounting for 33 percent) and 18 competitive sectors
(accounting for 30 percent). In 2015, Indonesia becomes is the most competitive in
agriculture with 24 competitive sectors (accounting for 39 percent), followed by
Thailand and Vietnam with 20 (accounting for 33 percent) and 18 competitive sectors
(accounting for 30 percent). Vietnam obtains the highest mean values of RCA in 1997
and on the average, followed by Indonesia and Thailand while Indonesia has the highest
mean value in 2015, followed by Thailand and Vietnam. In 2015, natural rubber is the
strongest competitive sector on Cambodia and Thailand, and the rank is not changed
over the period; fixed veg.fat,oils,other is the strongest competitive sector of Indonesia
and Malaysia; while Philippines, Vietnam, Singapore, and Brunei achieve the strongest
competitiveness in fuel wood, wood charcoal; edible prod.preprtns,nes; wood in chips,
particles; and non-alcohol.beverage,nes, respectively. Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia
exhibit strong competitiveness in agricultural sectors whilst Brunei, Singapore, and
Cambodia incur the weak competitiveness in agricultural sectors. The ASEAN
countries, in overall, obtain the strong competitiveness in crop and crop processing
sectors, wood sectors, and fishery sectors such as rice, natural rubber, spices, fixed
vegetable fats and oils, wood in chips, fuel wood, fish, and crustaceans (Table 5-1).

class are remained for all ASEAN countries under study in every year. The
classification of the index is presented as follows: (i) the un-competitive class: RCA ≤ 1;
(ii) the weak competitive class: 1 < RCA ≤ 2.72; (iii) the medium competitive class:
2.72 < RCA ≤ 7.22; and (iv) the strong competitive class: RCA > 7.22. The result shows
that Indonesia, Vietnam, and Thailand achieve the most number of strong competitive
sectors; Malaysia, Philippines, and Cambodia gain some strong competitive sectors
while Singapore and Brunei have no strong competitive sector (Table 5-2).

5.1.2 Agricultural competitiveness by the RTA
   The agricultural competitiveness of the ASEAN countries by the RTA index is
relatively different from by the RCA index. These countries, in general, decrease the
number of competitive agricultural sectors between 1997 and 2015. The ASEAN
countries obtain the competitiveness in 168 agricultural sectors in 1997 while they have
the competitiveness in only 148 agricultural sectors in 2015. In general, Thailand,
Vietnam, and Indonesia are still the strongest competitive countries in agricultural
sectors by the RTA index with the numbers of competitive sectors of 33, 37, and 25,
respectively in 2015. However, the high mean RTA value of 3.5 shows that Indonesia is
more specialized and the stronger competitive in agriculture than Thailand. Brunei,
Singapore, and Cambodia obtain the competitiveness in 2, 10, and 13 agricultural
sectors in 2015 and also become the weakest competitive countries in agriculture by the
RTA. The strongest agricultural sectors of the ASEAN countries are relatively similar
between the RCA and the RTA indices, excepting Brunei (Table 5-3).
   The differences between the results of the RCA and the RTA significantly clarify the
role of import in the calculation and competitiveness explanation. The positions of the
                                                    107



top strong competitiveness agricultural sectors of the ASEAN countries seem not to be
different between the RCA and RTA indices. This proves that the ASEAN countries
will specialize in producing and exporting the top strong competitiveness agricultural
commodities with the minimum or less imports of the similar agricultural products.

* The agricultural commodity code is presented in the Appendix 5.
5.1.3 Agricultural competitiveness by NRCA index
   The NRCA and the RCA present the same results of the numbers of competitive
sectors in the ASEAN countries. The only difference is the number of competitive
sectors in Vietnam on the average value due to the mean calculation of over period
1997-2015. This similarity can be explained by the nature on the NRCA formula
derived from the comparative-advantage-neutral point of the RCA index. The strongest
competitive sectors by the NRCA are, however, relatively different from those by the
RCA and the RTA. Indonesia, Malaysia, and Philippines achieve the strongest
competitiveness in fixed veg.fat,oils,other in 1997, 2015, and on the average while rice
and natural rubber, etc. are the strongest competitive sectors of Cambodia, Thailand, and
Vietnam. Brunei does not have the competitiveness in any agricultural sectors by the
NRCA index (Table 5-4).
   In general, there are the relative similarities of the agricultural competitiveness
patterns among Indonesia, Malaysia, and Philippines with the strongest competitiveness
in 422, 425, and 245; among Vietnam, Thailand, and Cambodia with the strongest
                                                        108



competitiveness in 042 and 231; and among Singapore and Brunei with the weak
competitiveness in agricultural sectors.

    The overall comparison of the agricultural competitiveness ranking between the
ASEAN countries is analyzed by the mean competitiveness ranks of all agricultural
sectors for these indices in 1997, 2015 and on the average. The result confirms that
Vietnam is the ASEAN 1st country in the agricultural competitiveness in 1997 and on
the average while Thailand is the strongest in 2015 by the RCA. By the RTA, Vietnam
is the ASEAN 1st country in the agricultural competitiveness in 1997 while Thailand is
the strongest in 2015 and on the average. It is notable that, Brunei and Cambodia
become the strongest agricultural export competitiveness by the NRCA (Table 5-5). The
possible explanation is due to the formula of the NRCA and the small values of the
                                           109



countries’ total exports. The small national exports results in the high ranks in many
agricultural sectors of Brunei and Cambodia in comparison with other ASEAN
countries with large national exports results. The result implies the NRCA is not a
perfectly appropriate indicator to measure and compare the general competitiveness
ranking of countries. The consistencies between the competitiveness indices will be
tested in the thesis after this.
5.1.4 Analyzing the dynamics of agricultural competitiveness indicators
The general pattern of the competitiveness indicators by OLS method
   The first type of the agricultural competitiveness dynamics in the ASEAN countries
are identified by OLS method. In this analysis, the RCA indicators are replaced by the
RSCA indicators with identical economic implications. The regression results indicate
that these countries, generally, have the convergent patterns in agricultural
competitiveness. It means that, these countries loss the competitiveness in the initial
strong competitive agricultural sectors while they gain the competitiveness in the initial
weak competitive agricultural sectors. In detail, Malaysia, Philippines, and Singapore
have the convergent patterns over the period 1997-2005 and the period 1997-2015 while
the countries have unidentified or divergent patterns over the period 2006-2015.
Vietnam has the convergent agricultural competitiveness patterns by the RSCA and the
RTA while it has the divergent agricultural competitiveness patterns by the NRCA.
Thailand, generally, has the convergent agricultural competitiveness patterns except for
the divergent competitiveness patterns by the RTA over the period 1997 – 2005.
Indonesia is a special case with the divergent or unidentified agricultural
competitiveness patterns by all indices over all periods. The competitiveness patterns of
Brunei and Cambodia are not clear due to the full data unavailability (Table 5-6).
The mobility and stability of the competitiveness indicators by Markov matrix
   The second type of the agricultural competitiveness dynamics is the mobility and
stability analysis based on the one-step Markov transition probability matrices. This
                                             110



method assesses if an agricultural sector will stay in its initial competitiveness class or
move to other class in Markov matrices in the next year. There are four classes in
Markov matrices. The boundaries of competitive and uncompetitive groups are
remained. The classification of non-competitiveness, medium competitiveness, and
strong competitiveness is identified by quartile method for each country for each index.
In general, the empirical result indicates high mobility of the RCA, RTA, and NRCA
indices for Brunei, Cambodia, and Singapore with the high M-Shorrocks index values,
the high average mobility values, and the low average stability values whilst Malaysia,
Thailand, and Indonesia obtain the most stabilities of these indices with the low M-
Shorrocks values, the high average stability values, and the low average mobility values.
The result shows a relatively low mobility of these indices for Vietnam and Philippines
(Table 5-7). More specifically, the analysis results confirm the very low degree of
transition of these indices from uncompetitive class (group 1) to competitive classes
(group 2, 3, 4). There is almost no moving from class 1 and class 2 to class 4. There is
also significantly low moving from class 4 to class 1 and class 2 except for Cambodia
and Brunei with high degree of transition from class 4 to class 1. The strong competitive
sectors are the most stable in Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia with the stability values
of over 90 percent, and highly stable in Indonesia and Philippines with the stability
values of over 87 percent. This means that these ASEAN countries can successfully
maintain their ranks of the agricultural competitiveness over time (Table 5-7).

5.2 The trade agricultural complementarity of the ASEAN countries
5.2.1 The agricultural trade complementarity of the ASEAN countries
    The complementarity analysis results in Table 5-8 show that all TCI values are
smaller than one and relatively close to zero. This, generally, implies that the ASEAN
countries are weakly complementary or strongly competing in the agricultural trade on
the global market. In other words, the agricultural export patterns of the ASEAN
countries weakly match the agricultural import patterns of the partner countries in the
ASEAN region in comparison with the agricultural commodity composition of the
international trade. The import complementarity values (M.TCI) represent the mean
import complementarity degree of one country to other ASEAN countries. The M.TCI
result shows that Brunei and Malaysia’s agricultural import patterns are the most
strongly complementary to the agricultural export patterns of other ASEAN countries
with the M.TCI values of 0.29 and 0.21 while Thailand and Singapore’s agricultural
import patterns are the most weakly complementary. The export complementarity
(X.TCI) values indicate the mean export complementarity degree of one country to
other ASEAN countries. The X.TCI result states that Vietnam and Thailand’s
agricultural export patterns are the most strongly complementary to the agricultural
import patterns of other ASEAN countries with the X.TCI values of 0.38 and 0.28.
Vietnam’ agricultural supply pattern is the most strongly complementary to the
agricultural demand patterns of Brunei, Indonesia, and Philippines with the TCI values
                                                     112



of 0.75, 0.55, and 0.54, respectively whilst Brunei and Singapore’s agricultural supply
patterns are not definitely complementary to the demand patterns of ASEAN countries.

    The general trend analysis of the mean TCI values of all ASEAN countries shows
that the agricultural complementarity degree of the ASEAN countries slightly decreases
over the period 1997-2015. This indicates that the ASEAN countries become less
complementary and more competing to each other along with their regional and global
integration process (Figure 5-1).

    The thesis, moreover, analyzes the degree of agricultural complementary of the
ASEAN countries by the TCIv of Vollrath and Johnston (2001). The TCIv values are
relatively similar to the TCI values of Drysdale (1969) and they indicate the same
economic implications and trend.

5.2.2 The agricultural export similarity of the ASEAN countries
    The ESI explains the trade complementarity between countries but this index focus
on comparing the export patterns of the ASEAN countries on the world market. The
results, in general, show the significantly low degree of similarities in the agricultural
export patterns of the ASEAN countries with the mean ESI value of 2.8. This means
that the ASEAN countries are strong complements in exporting the agricultural products
to the world market. This result is different from those of the TCI analysis as the TCI
analyzes the matching of a country’s export and its partner’s import while the ESI
compares the export patterns between countries. Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam have
the highest degree of agricultural export similarities to other ASEAN countries with the
mean ESI values of 4.73, 4.28, and 4.26 respectively. Brunei, Singapore, and Cambodia
obtain the lowest degree of agricultural export similarities to other ASEAN countries
with the mean ESI values of 0.09, 0.12, and 0.72, respectively. The country pairs of
Thailand-Vietnam and Indonesia-Malaysia have the most similarities in agricultural
export patterns with the SI values of 10.33 and 9.25 (Table 5-9).

    The general trend analysis for the mean ESI values of all ASEAN countries over the
period 1997-2015 indicates the increasing similarity degree in the agricultural export
patterns of the ASEAN countries. Similarly to the general trend of the mean TCI values,
this confirms that the ASEAN countries are becoming more similar or competing to
each other along with their regional and global integration process (Figure 5-2).

5.2.3 The agricultural complementarity by Spearman coefficients
   This study classifies the 𝜌𝑠 values into 4 groups to identify the degree of the
agricultural trade complementarity among countries: (i) strong complementarity: (-1, -
0.5); (ii) weak complementarity: (-0.5, 0); (iii) weak substitutability: (0, 0.5); and (4)
strong substitutability: (0.5, 1).
Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients of the RCA indicators
   The positive 𝜌𝑠 values of the RCA indicators in Table 5-10 show that the ASEAN
countries are relatively competing on the world market but they have the weak
competitions (or substitutability) in agricultural competitiveness structures with the
mean 𝜌𝑠 value of 0.43. Indonesia has the strongest agricultural trade substitutability for
other ASEAN countries with the mean 𝜌𝑠 value of 0.51 while Brunei obtains the
weakest agricultural trade substitutability for other ASEAN countries with the mean 𝜌𝑠

    The 𝜌𝑎 values of the RCA indicator have the increasing trend over time. This result
indicates that the agricultural trade competitiveness structures of the ASEAN countries
have been becoming more and more similar, competing or substitutable for each other.
In other words, the weaker countries catch up quickly with the stronger countries due to
the change in the agricultural competitiveness (Figure 5-3).
Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients of the RTA indicators
    The 𝜌𝑠 values of the RTA indicators show the stronger complementarity of the
agricultural commodity of the ASEAN countries in comparison with those of the RCA
indicator with the mean coefficients value of 0.15 and some negative 𝜌𝑠 values. Brunei
is the highest complementary to other ASEAN countries in the agricultural
competitiveness structures with the 𝜌𝑠 value of 0.06 while Indonesia is the highest
substitutable with the 𝜌𝑠 value of 0.28. The country pairs of Singapore-Thailand,
Brunei-Thailand, Brunei-Vietnam, and Singapore-Vietnam are the most complementary
with the 𝜌𝑠 values of -0.30, -0.24, -0.21, and -0.10, respectively (Table 5-11). Moreover,
the decreasing general trend of the 𝜌𝑠 values of the RTA indicators means that the
degree of the agricultural complementarity of the ASEAN countries is becoming
stronger (Figure 5-3). In other words, the ASEAN countries are becoming less
competing and more supporting to each other on the world agricultural markets. The
results are contrary to those of the RCA indicators. The possible explanation for this
may be due to the components difference in the RCA’s and the RTA’s formulas.

Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients of the NRCA indicators
    The result of the NRCA indicators is relatively similar to those of the RCA
indicators. The positive 𝜌𝑠 values of the NRCA indicators show that the ASEAN
countries are competing on the world markets and they have the relative substitutability
in agricultural competitiveness structures with the mean 𝜌𝑠 value of 0.37. Indonesia has
the strongest substitutability for other ASEAN countries while Cambodia obtains the
weakest substitutability. Vietnam is relatively substitutable to the ASEAN countries in
agricultural competitiveness pattern, especially to Indonesia and Thailand (Table 5-12).

    The decreasing general trend of the 𝜌𝑠 values of the NRCA indicators means that the
level of the agricultural complementarity of the ASEAN countries is becoming stronger
(Figure 5-3). In other words, the ASEAN countries are becoming less competing and
more supporting to each other on the world agricultural markets. This result is relatively
different to that of the RCA indicator but similar to that of the RTA indicator.

5.2.4 The impact of external markets and factors
   The research results, in general, demonstrate that the ASEAN countries are weakly
complementary in matching the regional agricultural import demands while they are
relatively complementary in exporting agricultural products to the global market. These
countries’ agricultural trade flows and competitiveness patterns are more affected by
and benefited from the global integration than the regional integration. It is remarkable
that the ASEAN countries tend to become more and more competing or substitutable on
both regional and global markets. The potential explanation for these issues is the
economic linkages, dependences or trade relations between the ASEAN and the external
markets, especially the giant and close markets. China (including Hong Kong), the U.S.,
Japan, India, and Australia are the top agricultural trade partners of the ASEAN
countries with the shares of the ASEAN agricultural export of 15 percent, 10.5 percent,
7.3 percent, 6 percent, and 2.3 percent, respectively in 2016. These markets, in total,
account for over 41 percent of agricultural export value, equal to US$ 49,809 million,
and 38 percent of agricultural import value, equal to US$ 38,714 million, in the ASEAN
countries in 2016 (Figure 5-4 and 5-5). China, India, and Australia are the most
                                             118



increasing import markets of the ASEAN’s agricultural export with the annual growth
rate of 14 percent, 18 percent, and 13 percent, respectively, over the period 2001-2016.

   It is suggested that the ASEAN countries have to expand and predominantly focus
on the external global markets based on the international trade and economic
agreements and partnerships of the association or the member individual countries to
avoid the fierce competition in the regional markets and to enhance the economic and
trade development. This strategy may cause the higher competition pressure on the
world agricultural commodity markets.
                                          119



   The trade structure and its dynamics commonly reflect the deep structure of a
country’s economy and production in nature as the resources and competitive
advantages cannot change quickly despite sudden shocks, new technology, and
institutional systems. Though the ASEAN countries, in general, have advantages to
produce agricultural products from the appropriate natural environment, fertile soil, and
abundant water, they face the problems of increasing input costs, unstable and growing
market prices due to the land degradation, the climate change, the negative
environmental impact, and changing politics and economic conditions (Hoang et al,
2017). Moreover, the food price crisis in 2007-2008 results in the significantly negative
impact on the ASEAN countries’ food security and thus they have to change the
agricultural production system and food policy to ensure the national food security such
as the Philippines with the promoting self-sufficiency, subsidies to farmers, and
consumer price controls or subsidies; Malaysia and Myanmar with the promoting self-
sufficiency; Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand with export restrictions; Thailand,
Indonesia, Malaysia, and Cambodia with consumer price controls or subsidies (Wana
and Andreosso-O'Callaghan, 2017; Chandra and Lontoh, 2010). The change of
agricultural production systems and food policies of the ASEAN countries may
remarkably affect the agricultural trade flows in the ASEAN region, the agricultural
trade competitiveness patterns on the world market, and significantly explain the
reasons why these countries tend to be more substitutable in the internally regional
markets while they are more complementary on the international markets.
5.3 The consistencies of the trade performance indices: country-ranking
   The country-ranking consistency tests among the RCA, the RTA, and NRCA indices
in the ASEAN countries as cardinal measures show that these indices are strongly
consistent with correlation coefficients of larger 0.7. The RCA & the RTA are the most
strongly consistent pair with the correlation coefficient of 0.91. As ordinal measures,
however, these comparative advantage indices are relatively weak consistent to rank the
                                           120



competitiveness positions of countries in an agricultural sector (country-ranking) with
the mean correlation coefficients of 0.58, 0.38, and 0.42 between the RCA & the RTA,
the RCA & the NRCA, and the RTA & the NRCA, respectively. As dichotomous
measures, the RCA & the NRCA are perfectly consistent with the matching shares of 1
due to the derivation of the NRCA from the neutral-point of the RCA. The consistencies
between the RTA & the RCA, the RTA & the NRCA are relatively strong and similar
with the same mean matching shares of 0.8 (Table 5-13).
   The results, generally, prove that these competitive advantage indices are strongly
consistent as cardinal and dichotomous measures while they are weakly consistent as
ordinal measures. In other words, these indices are strongly consistent to measure the
degrees of competitiveness of a country in a sector and determine whether a country has
competitiveness in a sector, while they are weakly consistent to rank the
competitiveness positions of the countries in a sector.
   Moreover, the counting both export and import data in the RTA may not
significantly impact on identifying the degrees of the agricultural competitiveness and
determining whether a country obtains the competitiveness in an agricultural sector
while the import counting may relatively change the competitiveness rankings of the
agricultural sectors. In other words, the countries will focus on specializing in and
exporting their competitive agricultural sectors and restrict the imports of the similar
agricultural products.

   CHAPTER 6:           THE COMPETITIVENESS OF ALTERNATIVE
        AGRICULTURAL CROPS: A CASE STUDY OF BEN TRE
   The chapter 5 and chapter 6 assess the agricultural competitiveness by the trade
approach at the national and regional levels. The results provide the understanding of
the performance competitiveness between sectors in the national scope and between
countries in the regional scope in the global markets. This chapter aims to expand the
comprehending the competitiveness theory and the empirical studies by assessing the
comparative advantages of alternative agricultural production systems of rice, coconut,
and pomelo by the economic and production indicators in the PAM model in case of
Ben Tre province. The sensitivity analysis is used to understand the dynamics of these
indicators by three scenarios.
   The results, in general, indicate that pomelo achieves the strongest comparative
advantage with the PCR of 0.16, the DRC of 0.13, and the SCB of 0.15, coconut obtains
the medium comparative advantage the PCR of 0.53 and the DRC of 0.38, and the SCB
of 0.42 while rice has the weakest comparative advantage with the PCR of 0.92, the
DRC of 0.63, and the SCB of 0.71. The rice, coconut, and pomelo are not, generally,
supported or protected by the government with the NPCO values of 0.72, 0.59, and 0.69,
respectively. These agricultural production systems may obtain, however, the subsidy
by the government with the NPCI values of 0.85 for rice, 0.85 for coconut, and 0.86 for
pomelo. The EPC and PC values of rice, coconut, and pomelo are smaller than the unity
and the results indicate the net disincentives of the government for the rice, coconut, and
pomelo production systems. The study, moreover, confirms the overall transfers from
the private producers of rice, coconut, and pomelo sectors to the general society with the
SRP values of -0.25, -0.33, and -0.29, respectively. Especially, the social profit
indicators are higher than the private profit indicators. This seems to be different from
the other countries, especially in OECD countries.
                                             122



   The sensitivity analysis shows that it makes rice become non-profitable at the market
price while the sector is still competitive at the social price. The PAM indicators of
coconut and pomelo seem to be changed insignificantly. Second, if the rice, coconut,
and pomelo private producers have to pay the water and land charges the private rice
producer will get loss while coconut and pomelo producers still obtain profits. The
payments of the water and land charges to the government do not impact on the PAM
indicators at social prices. Finally, the sensitivity of the PAM indicators to the assuming
changes of output prices, fertilizer prices, land rent prices, production productivity, and
the real effective exchange rate by the scope of ±5, ±10, ±15 and ±20 percent. The
results, generally, show that rice output price and productivity decreases make the
private producers get lost at the point of 10 percent only. All other comparative
advantage indicators at the private and social prices are stable in the nature or still in the
interval {0, 1} with the assuming changes of the variables by that scope.
   This section, moreover, measures these crops by the trade performance indices to
compare the trade and the economic approaches. The results show that rice obtains the
strongest competitiveness by the RCA, the RTA, and NRCA while it has the weakest
competitiveness by the DRC and the SCB. Pomelo has the weakest competitiveness by
the RCA, the RTA, and NRCA while it obtains the strongest competitiveness by the
DRC and the SCB. Coconut has the medium competitiveness by all frameworks.
6.1 Measuring the comparative advantage of the alternative crops
6.1.1 The comparative advantage of rice
   Table 6-1 summarizes the revenues, costs, and profits at both private and social
prices, as well as the divergences and comparative advantage indicators of the rice
sector. The results show that the rice private activity is obtaining profitability with the
net profit value of VND 3,196,934 per hectare per year with the private revenue of VND
51,603,705 per hectare per year. However, the private cost ratio is relatively high with
the value of 0.92 and it means that the rice is a weakly competitive or low profitable
                                           123



sector. The rice sector results in the extremely higher revenues and profits at social
prices than at private prices with the values of VND 71,757,318 and VND 21,147,271.
There is a significant difference between the efficiency values at social prices and
private prices. The divergences of revenues and profits at social prices and at private
prices are VND -20,153,613 and VND -17,950,337. The main divergences are from the
tax and real effective exchange rate policies in Vietnam. Specifically, the general
markup tax is about 20 percent; transport, fertilizer, and service taxes are about 10
percent; and the real effective exchange rate is an about 36 percent higher than the
official effective exchange rate. In other words, the divergences obtained from the effect
of the policies of the undervaluation of the exchange rate in output, the taxes, and the
price on the domestic market are higher than the divergence generated by the effect of
the policy of undervaluation of the exchange rate in tradable inputs, the subsidies to the
cost of the state land charge, the irrigation water charge, and others. This means that
though the rice generates small profits to private actors it results in relatively great
social values in Vietnam.
   The DRC and the SCB indicators are used to access the comparative advantage of
the agricultural production system. The result in Table 3 shows that the domestic
resource cost indicator is smaller than unity with the DRC value of 0.63. This indicates
the comparative advantage and the economic profitability obtained in the rice
production system in Ben Tre. The result also shows that the social net value-added is
greater than the social costs of domestic production factors. The result of the domestic
resource cost indicator is supported by the social cost-benefit ratio with the SCB ratio of
0.71 obtained in the rice production system in Ben Tre. The SCB < 1, moreover,
implies that the sum of tradable inputs and domestic factors costs are smaller than the
total revenue under the current output and input market conditions. These greater 0.5
values of the DRC and the SCB, however, indicate the weak comparative advantage of
the rice production system in Ben Tre.

    The nominal protection coefficient is the ratio between the revenue, cost, and profit
paid to the private actors in an agricultural production system with the market price and
the revenue, cost, and profit of all actors in the economy with the social price. The rice
production system analysis in Ben Tre results in the NPCO value of 0.72 and the NPCI
value of 0.85. The NPCO value of 0.72 means that the domestic output price is lower
than the foreign output price and the sector is not protected or supported by the
government. The NPCI value of 0.85 implies that the domestic input price is lower than
the foreign input price and the agricultural production is subsidized by the government.
The results of the NPCI and the NPCO are supported and enhanced by the EPC and PC
indicators. The EPC and PC values of 0.69 and 0.15 indicate a net disincentive of the
government for the rice production systems. The SRP value of -0.25 generally confirms
the overall transfer from the private producers of rice production system to the society.
    The thesis also measures the competitiveness of Vietnam’s rice sector by the trade
performance indices such as the RCA, the RTA, and the NRCA to compare and enhance
the results of measuring the rice comparative advantage by the economic indicators. The
results show the relatively strong competitiveness of rice export with the RCA, the
                                            125



RTA, and the NRCA values of 5.88, 6.25, and 0.86, respectively in 2016 (Table 6-2).
The indicators, however, seem to be decreased over the period 2010-2016. This result
supports to the result by the economic indicators that the rice production system obtains
both production comparative advantages and export competitiveness.

6.1.2 The comparative advantage of coconut
   The revenues, costs, and profits at both private and social prices, as well as the
divergences and comparative advantage indicators of the coconut production system, are
presented in Table 6-3. The results show that the coconut private activity is obtaining
profitability with the net profit value of VND 32,555,867 per hectare per year with the
private revenue of VND 76,513,783 per hectare per year. The private cost ratio value of
0.53 explains that the coconut is a medium competitive or profitable production sector.
The coconut sector results in the relatively higher revenues and profits at social prices
than at private prices with the values of VND 130,004,909 and VND 74,915,361. There
is a significant difference between the coconut efficiency at social prices and private
prices. The revenue and profit divergences at social prices and at private prices are VND
-53,491,126 and VND -42,359,494. Similar to the explanation above, the main
divergences are from the tax and real effective exchange rate policies in Vietnam.
Specifically, the general markup tax is about 20 percent; transport, fertilizer, and service
taxes are about 10 percent; and the real effective exchange rate is an about 36 percent
higher than the official effective exchange rate. In other words, the divergences obtained
from the effect of the policies of the undervaluation of the exchange rate in output, the
taxes, and the price on the domestic market are higher than the divergence generated by
the effect of the policy of undervaluation of the exchange rate in tradable inputs, the
                                             126



subsidies to the cost of the state land charge, the irrigation water charge, and others.
This means that though the coconut sector in Vietnam creates low profits to private
actors it results in higher social values.
   The DRC and the SCB indicators are used to access the comparative advantage of
the agricultural production system. The result of coconut analysis in Table 5 shows that
the domestic resource cost indicator is smaller than unity with the DRC value of 0.38.
This implies the comparative advantage and the economic profitability obtained in the
coconut production system in Ben Tre. The result also indicates that the social net
value-added is greater than the social opportunity costs of domestic production factors.
The result of the domestic resource cost indicator is supported by the social cost-benefit
ratio with the SCB ratio of 0.42 obtained in the coconut production system in Ben Tre.
The SCB < 1, moreover, explains that the sum of tradable inputs and domestic factors
costs are smaller than the total revenue under the current output and input market
conditions. These smaller 0.5 values of the DRC and the SCB indicate the relatively
strong comparative advantage of the coconut production system in Ben Tre.
   The nominal protection coefficient is the ratio between the revenue, cost, and profit
paid to the private actors in an agricultural production system with the market price and
the revenue, cost, and profit of all actors in the economy with the social price. The
coconut production system analysis in Ben Tre results in the NPCO value of 0.59 and
the NPCI value of 0.85. The NPCO value of 0.59 shows that the domestic output price
is lower than the foreign output price and the sector is not protected or supported by the
government. The NPCI value of 0.85 indicates that the domestic input price is lower
than the foreign input price and the agricultural production is subsidized by the
government. The results of the NPCI and the NPCO are supported and enhanced by the
EPC and PC indicators. The EPC and PC values of 0.57 and 0.43 indicate the net
disincentive of the government for the coconut production systems. Moreover, the SRP
                                                 127



value of -0.33 confirms the general transfer from private producers in the coconut
production value chain to society.

    The thesis, moreover, evaluates the competitiveness of the coconut sector of
Vietnam by the trade performance indices such as the RCA, the RTA, and the NRCA to
compare the results of evaluating the coconut comparative advantage by the economic
indicators. The results show the relatively weak competitiveness of coconut export with
the RCA, the RTA, and the NRCA values of 1.56, 1.60, and 0.02, respectively in 2016
(Table 6-4). The indicators tend be declined over the period 2010-2016. This result
seems to be different to the result by the economic indicators that the coconut
production system achieves relatively strong production comparative advantages but
obtains relatively weak export competitiveness.

6.1.3 The comparative advantage of pomelo
   In general, the pomelo production system generates much higher private and social
values in comparison with rice and coconut systems. The results in Table 6-5 shows the
revenues, costs, and profits at both private and social prices, as well as the divergences
and comparative advantage indicators of the pomelo production system. The results
show that the pomelo private activity is obtaining profitability with the net profit value
of VND 369,464,491 per hectare per year with the private revenue of VND
456,535,111per hectare per year. The private cost ratio value of 0.16 explains that the
pomelo is a strong competitive or high profitable value chain. The coconut sector also
results in the higher revenues and profits at social prices than at private prices with the
values of VND 659,578,488 and VND 559,225,182. There is a significant difference
between the coconut efficiency at social prices and private prices. The revenue and
profit divergences at social prices and at private prices are VND -203,043,377 and VND
-189,760,691. Similar to the explanation in rice analysis, the main divergences are from
the tax and real effective exchange rate policies in Vietnam. In detail, the general
markup tax is about 20 percent; transport, fertilizer, and service taxes are about 10
percent; and the real effective exchange rate is an about 36 percent higher than the
official effective exchange rate. In other words, the divergences obtained from the effect
of the policies of the undervaluation of the exchange rate in output, the taxes, and the
price on the domestic market are higher than the divergence generated by the effect of
the policy of undervaluation of the exchange rate in tradable inputs, the subsidies to the
cost of the state land charge, the irrigation water charge, and others. This means that the
pomelo sector in Vietnam creates higher revenues and profits at social prices (society in
general) than at private prices (private actors).
   The DRC and the SCB indicators are used to access the comparative advantage of
the agricultural production system. The result of pomelo analysis in Table 7 shows that
the pomelo domestic resource cost indicator is smaller than unity with the DRC value of
                                           129



0.13. This implies the comparative advantage and the economic profitability obtained in
the pomelo production system in Ben Tre. The result also indicates that the social net
value-added is much higher than the social opportunity costs of domestic production
factors. The result of the domestic resource cost indicator is enhanced by the social cost-
benefit ratio with the SCB ratio of 0.15 obtained in the pomelo production system in
Ben Tre. The SCB < 1, moreover, explains that the sum of tradable inputs and domestic
factors costs are smaller than the total revenue under the current output and input market
conditions. These close to 0 values of the DRC and the SCB indicate the extremely
strong comparative advantage of the pomelo production system in Ben Tre.
   The nominal protection coefficient is the ratio between the revenue, cost, and profit
paid to the private actors in an agricultural production system with the market price and
the revenue, cost, and profit of all actors in the economy with the social price. The
pomelo production system analysis in Ben Tre results in the NPCO value of 0.69 and
the NPCI value of 0.89. The NPCO value of 0.69 shows that the domestic output price
is lower than the foreign output price and the pomelo sector is not protected or
supported by the government. The NPCI value of 0.89 indicates that the domestic input
price is lower than the foreign input price and the pomelo production is subsidized by
the government. The results of the NPCI and the NPCO are supported by the EPC and
PC indicators. The EPC and PC values of 0.69 and 0.66 indicate a net disincentive of
the government for the pomelo production systems. The SRP value of -0.29 indicates
the transfer from the private producers in the pomelo production system to the society.
   The thesis also measures the competitiveness of the pomelo sector by the trade
performance indices to compare the results of evaluating the pomelo comparative
advantage by these economic indicators. The results show the comparative disadvantage
of pomelo export with the RCA, the RTA, and the NRCA values of 0.23, -0.09, and -
0.01, respectively in 2016 (Table 6-6). The indicators tend to decrease over the period
2010-2016. This result seems to be in contrast to those by the economic indicators that
                                                 130



the pomelo sector achieves the extremely strong production comparative advantage
whilst it has the comparative disadvantage in exporting to the world market.

6.2 Indicators and sectors consistency and comparison analysis
    The PAM indicators indicate that pomelo obtains the strongest production
competitiveness with the DRC of 0.13 and SCB of 0.15 in comparison with coconut and
rice. It is followed by coconut with the DRC of 0.38 and SCB of 0.42. Rice is the
weakest production competitiveness sector with the DRC of 0.63 and SCB of 0.71. The
trade competitiveness indices, however, lead to the different results. Rice is the
strongest export competitiveness with the RCA of 5.88, the RTA of 6.25, and the NRCA
of 0.86. It followed by coconut with the RCA of 1.56, the RTA of 1.60, and the NRCA
of 0.02. Especially, pomelo is the strongest competitiveness sector by the PAM
                                             131



indicators while it is definitely uncompetitive by the trade performance indices with the
RCA of 0.23, the RTA of -0.09, and the NRCA of -0.01 (Table 6-7). This result seems
to be contrasting to the economic theory which considers the PAM indicators as the
determinants of the trade performance competitiveness. In other words, the sectors with
strong production comparative advantages will obtain stronger export competitiveness
on the world market while the sectors with weak production comparative advantages
will be weaker export competitiveness on the world market. The potential explanation
for this theoretical and practical issue is as follows:
   This is the matter of definitions of the competitiveness of a nation and a sector. The
traditional theory defines the comparative advantage of a country in a sector if the
country can produce the product with higher productivity or lower cost and lower price
finally and obtain higher relative market shares on the world markets (Smith, 1776;
Ricardo, 1817; Balassa, 1965). The product of the country with comparatively lower
price on the global market will achieve higher relative market shares in comparison with
other countries and commodities. In this case, higher relative market shares (or
comparative advantage) and lower price (or higher productivity) are synonymous. The
export comparative advantage and the relative market shares can be measured by the
trade performance indices such as the RCA, the RTA, the NRCA, the LFI, and the GLI.
   On the other hand, the competitiveness can be also defined as the ability of a nation,
a sector, and a company to generate, while being and remaining exposed to international
competition, relatively high and rising income and factor employment levels on a
sustainable basis (Hatzichronologou, 1996) or to provide its population with high rising
standards of living and high level of employment for all those willing to work, on a
sustainable basis (EU, 2003). In this definition, the competitiveness is synonymous with
or positively related to higher profit and income for farmers and producers in an
agricultural production system. Moreover, to have higher profit and income, the farmers
and producers should obtain higher prices (and revenue), higher productivity, and lower
                                          132



costs. As the result, the higher prices will lead to the stronger competitiveness of a
nation or a production system under the constant conditions of the productivity and
costs. The PAM indicators are the most adequate and basic measures for this definition
of competitiveness. The statement may be the answer for the contrasting results of the
trade performance indices and the PAM indicators.
   In this empirical study, rice obtains the strongest trade competitiveness while it has
the weakest production comparative advantage. The product is a main production
system of Vietnam with large cropland areas and export share in total exports. The rice
price is dependent on the world rice price and relatively low. Moreover, Vietnam’s rice
production system employs the traditional technology with small-scale farms, low-
skilled workers, and increasing input costs of fertilizers and pesticides. As the result,
rice may achieve a high relative market share whilst it is relatively low profitable
production system. On the other hand, Da Xanh pomelo has the comparative
disadvantage in export measured by the trade performance indices while it obtains the
relatively strong competitiveness in production measured by the PAM indicators. Da
Xanh pomelo is a specialty product of Ben Tre, Vietnam with outstanding
characteristics and quality which are preferred and highly evaluated by the local
consumers. The clients are, therefore, willing to pay a higher price for the product. Da
Xanh pomelo, however, has a relatively limited cropland areas and extremely small
export due to high price and limited quantity. Therefore, Da Xanh pomelo may result in
high profitability and income to the farmers and producers in the production system
while it has the comparative disadvantage in exporting to the world market. Coconut
seems to be the harmonious and neutral sector with medium competitiveness by the
trade performance indices and the PAM indicators. The product of material coconut is
mainly used to produce coconut products such as coconut fiber, coconut peat, coconut
cell coal, desiccated coconut, and coconut jelly. Most of these coconut products are
exported and dependent on the world prices. Coconut production system may obtain
                                             133



both export and production competitiveness as on the high productivity, modern
processing technology, and good product quality with relatively large cropland areas
and low export prices (Khai et al., 2011).

   In conclusion, various frameworks may measure the different perspectives and
angles of competitiveness such as trade, production, society, environment, policy,
linkage, and general development based on the data sources. Each index can answer and
explain one or some objectives and fields of research and some indicators may be
contrasting. Depending on the research and policy objectives and conditions, scholars
should employ the appropriate framework or combine various frameworks and
indicators harmoniously. This study, however, has the limit of data scope in Ben Tre
and Vietnam and time in 2016 with three agricultural sectors. The future research should
be expanded and employ the larger data scope in longer time with more sectors. Another
limitation of this study is that it uses the data of a typical type and location of a product
(rice, coconut, and pomelo) for production competitiveness while employing general
data for export competitiveness.
   Moreover, the authors employ the different approach to calculate the land
opportunity cost of rice, coconut, and pomelo based on Yao (1997b). The highest social
profit of a sector, namely pomelo with VND 559,225,182, will be used as the land
opportunity cost for rice and coconut. The second high social profit of a sector, namely
coconut with VND 74,915,361, will be used as the land opportunity cost for pomelo.
The result, shown in Table 6-8, indicates that rice and coconut become significantly
uncompetitive with the DRC of 10.10, the SCB of 8.23 for rice and the DRC of 4.92,
SCB of 4.67 for coconut. Pomelo still obtains the strong competitiveness with the DRC
                                          134



of 0.17 and SCB of 0.19 with a slight decrease against the above results. In other words,
in the same arable cropland, the farmers should produce the profitable sector with the
account of the land opportunity cost of cultivating other crops. This method may be
useful to compare the alternative crops of pomelo and coconut. It, however, seems to
have the limitation that it does not take account of the land transferring cost from
pomelo crop into rice crop. Moreover, it is necessary to consider the natural conditions
and climate changes on which the crops are suitable and well adapted.

6.3 Sensitive analysis of the comparative advantage indicators
6.3.1 Climate changes
   The Mekong Delta of Vietnam in 2016 encounters the problem of the drought and
salinity intrusion due to the sea level rise and the reduction of Mekong river water flow
which are results of the rain decline and the hydroelectric plants along the Mekong river
in China, Thailand, Lao, and Cambodia. The disaster results in the significant decrease
of production yields of rice and pomelo by 14 percent and 5 percent while coconut
seems not to be impacted by the 1 percent increase of production yield. The changes in
the production productivity will make the comparative advantages of these crops
change. The result shows that rice does not has the private profit and competitiveness
with the decrease of production yields by 14 percent with the PP value of VND -
4,027,585 and the PRC value of 1.12. The crop still obtains the comparative advantage
with the DRC value of 0.77 and the SCB value of 0.82. Though pomelo bears the 5
percent reduction in production yield its comparative advantage indicators seem to be
stable. The potential explanation is that pomelo has the extremely strong
competitiveness with high private and social profits. Therefore, the 5 percent reduction
                                                135



in production yield may not impact on the PAM indicators. The 1 percent increase of
coconut production yield is relatively small and able not to impact on the private and
social profits of the crop. The PAM indicators of coconut, therefore, are almost
unchanged (Table 6-9).

6.3.2 Water and land charges
    Water and land charges are important parts of inputs costs of agricultural production
systems. Vietnam’s farmers used to pay for the charges. The charges have been,
however, supported by the government recently while the society generally still bears
these costs. The study assumes that rice, coconut, and pomelo farmers still pay for the
charges and calculates that PAM indicators of these crops.

   The results present that the rice private producer gets loss or negative profit if they
pay for water and land charges. The private profitability and cost ratio indicators of
coconut sector slightly decrease and those of pomelo production system are almost
similar. The social indicators in the PAM matrices of rice, coconut, and pomelo are
unchanged (Table 6-10).
6.3.3 The parameters of assuming changes of the variables
   The research analyzes the changes of the PAM indicators of rice, coconut, and
pomelo production systems according to the changes of the output prices, the fertilizer
prices, the land rent prices, the yield of production, and the real effective exchange rates
by the parameters of by ±5, ±10, ±15 and ±20 percent. The authors, moreover, identify
the breakpoints where the private and social competitiveness are neutral with the private
and social profitability of zero. In other words, at the private breakpoint, the private
agricultural producers or actors will make no profit with the PRC of the unity. At the
social breakpoint, the agricultural production systems will make no profit at the social
prices with the DRC and the SCB of the unity. The results may be presented as follows
(the detail calculations are presented in the Appendices 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20):
   Coconut and pomelo production systems obtain the comparative advantages by all
private and social PAM indicators when the output prices of coconut and pomelo
products decrease by 20 percent. The private and social breakpoints of coconut are the
output price decrease of 21.6 percent and 36.4 percent. The private and social
breakpoints of pomelo are the output price decrease of 61.8 percent and 70.5 percent.
On the other hand, rice is not profitable for private producer at the declining level of 10
percent while it is still profitable for society at the declining level of 20 percent. The
private and social breakpoints of rice sector are the output price decrease of 5.49 percent
and 24.7 percent. In general, the private and social comparative advantages of rice
production system are relatively sensitive to the changes of rice export price, especially
the private indicators. Whereas, the private and social comparative advantages of
                                            137



coconut and pomelo production systems are definitely stable under the changes of
coconut and pomelo export prices
   The results of a second scenario of changing the fertilizer prices in the assuming
scope show that all the comparative advantage indicators of the PRC, the DRC, and the
SCB are higher than the neutral points. The private and social breakpoints of rice
production system are the fertilizer price increases of 45.5 percent and 262 percent. The
private and social breakpoints of coconut sector are the fertilizer price increases of 584
percent and 1,164 percent. The private and social breakpoints of pomelo crop are the
fertilizer price increases of 3,154 percent and 4,270 percent. In overall, the changes in
the fertilizer prices insignificantly impact on the private and social competitiveness of
rice, coconut, and pomelo without making the sectors to become uncompetitive.
   Similar to the fertilizer prices, the changes of land rent prices in the assuming scope
may not make these agricultural production systems become uncompetitive with the
higher than the neutral points of the PRC, the DRC, and the SCB values. The private
and social breakpoints of rice production system are the land rent price increases of 31.2
percent and 207 percent. The private and social breakpoints of coconut sector are the
land rent price increases of 354.8 percent and 1,041 percent. The private and social
breakpoints of pomelo crop are the land rent price increases of 4,919 percent and 9,915
percent. In general, the changing in the land rent prices in the assuming scope slightly
impact on the private and social competitiveness of rice, coconut, and pomelo
production systems.
   The changes of production yields impact on the comparative advantages of the
agricultural production systems more strongly in comparison with the changes of the
fertilizer and land rent prices. The rice private producer will get lost if the productivity
decreases by 10 percent. The rice production system is the most sensitive to the
production productivity with the private and social breakpoints of -6.2 percent and -29.5
percent. The changes in production yields in the assuming scope do not make the
                                            138



coconut and pomelo production systems become uncompetitive with the higher than the
neutral points of the PRC, the DRC, and the SCB indicators. The private and social
breakpoints of coconut sector are the production yield decreases of 42.5 percent and
57.6 percent. The private and social breakpoints of pomelo crop are the production yield
decreases of 78.9 percent and 84.8 percent.
   The changes in the real effective exchange rates, generally, impact on the social
competitiveness indicators only. The changes of the variable in the assuming scope,
however, cannot make these agricultural production systems to be uncompetitive with
the higher than the neutral points of the DRC, and the SCB values. The social
breakpoints of rice, coconut, and pomelo production systems are the real effective
exchange rates decreases of 32.7 percent, 37.9 percent, and 72.2 percent, respectively.
In general, the rice and coconut sectors is the more strongly sensitive to than the pomelo
sector to the changes in the real effective exchange rates.

         CHAPTER 7:            CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS
   The systematic literature review indicates that competitiveness is a key pillar in
economic theory and an important concept in empirical and practical studies. The
concept may be defined in many ways with various perspectives and measured by
several frameworks. The comprehensive literature review confirms that there is a
significant research gap in investigating the competitiveness of Vietnam’s agricultural
sector by a multi-level approach and comparing the consistency or difference between
various approaches of measuring agricultural competitiveness. The dissertation, in
general, has four research objectives such as first assessing the static and dynamic
agricultural competitiveness of Vietnam; second, investigating and compare the
agricultural trade patterns Vietnam in comparison to the ASEAN countries; third,
evaluate the agricultural comparative advantages of the alternative agricultural
production systems of rice, coconut, and pomelo in the same agro-ecological conditions
through the case study in Ben Tre province, Mekong Delta; and fourth, empirically
analyzing the consistency and theoretically comparing the differences and meanings of
the competitiveness trade indices and economic indicators. The dissertation has
successfully obtained these research objectives and the research results can be shortly
concluded and presented in the next sections of 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, and 8.4 as follows:
7.1 Vietnam’s agricultural trade competitiveness
   This thesis first provides the empirical and practical evidences of the agricultural
competitiveness of Vietnam in the world markets and the agricultural competitiveness
changes over time by the trade performance approach. The country, in 2014, obtains the
competitive advantages in 19 agricultural sectors with 4 strong competitive sectors, 4
medium competitive sectors, and 11 weak competitive sectors by the RCA; in 27
agricultural sectors with 7 strong competitive sectors, 4 medium competitive sectors,
and 16 weak competitive sectors by the RTA; in 19 agricultural sectors with 9 strong
competitive sectors, 2 medium competitive sectors, and 8 weak competitive sectors by
                                            140



the NRCA. Vietnam obtains the strongest competitiveness in the agricultural sectors of
wood in chips, spices, rice, natural rubber, coffee, crustaceans, and fish. The country,
generally, has strong comparative advantages in crop sectors such as spices, rice, coffee,
tea & mate, fruit & nut and vegetables; and fishery sectors such as fish and crustaceans
whilst it has weak competitiveness in livestock sectors such as live animal, meat, eggs &
birds; and processed food sectors such as chocolate, cheese, and processed meat &
foods. In other words, the country has the agricultural export strategy and
competitiveness pattern based on the natural-resource-intensive and primary agricultural
sectors with relatively low values added.
   The dynamics analysis by OLS estimation for the RSCA (the RCA) and the RTA
indicators shows that Vietnam has the convergent pattern in the agricultural
competitiveness. In other words, the country loses the competitiveness in the initial
strong competitive sectors whilst it gains the competitiveness in the initial weak
competitive sectors. However, OLS estimation for the NRCA values results in a
divergent pattern in agricultural competitiveness. In other words, Vietnam gains the
increasing competitiveness in the initial strong competitive sectors whilst it loses the
competitiveness in the initial weak competitive sectors. Markov matrices for the RCA,
the RTA, and the NRCA, generally, indicate that the country stably maintains the
degrees of competitiveness of the agricultural sectors. The comparative disadvantage
sectors and strong comparative advantage sectors are the most stable to remain in their
initial classes of competitiveness, especially the strong competitive sectors by the
NRCA perfectly stay in its class. The trend analysis reveals that Vietnam obtains the
gaining trends in 19 agricultural sectors by the RCA, 12 agricultural sectors by the RTA,
and 14 agricultural sectors by the NRCA. The country, however, has the losing trends in
23 agricultural sectors by the RCA, 28 agricultural sectors by the RTA, and in 37
agricultural sectors by the NRCA.
                                          141



   In overall, the dynamics analysis also proves that Vietnam’s export strategy and
comparative advantage pattern is relatively dependent on the natural-resource-intensive
and traditional agricultural sectors such as crop and fishery sectors over time. Though
there are changes in the competitiveness rankings of the strongest competitive
commodities and the convergent pattern in the agricultural competitiveness over the
period 1997-2014 which may be considered as a small improvement of the export and
economic growth pattern, the natural-resource-intensive and traditional products are the
strongest competitive and main agricultural export sectors of Vietnam. The natural-
resource-intensive export strategy should be important in the initial period of
industrialization, economic development, and globalization but not be appropriate and
effective in the medium and long terms. The country, therefore, should re-structure and
enhance the effective agricultural production and competitiveness patterns with focusing
on the high value-added, technology-intensive, capital-intensive, and market-oriented
products based on the regional and global integration and value chain.
7.2 The ASEAN countries’ agricultural trade patterns
   Secondly, the thesis contributes to both empirical and theoretical literature by
investigating the ASEAN countries’ agricultural trade patterns and analyzing the
agricultural complementarity or competition between these countries on the world
markets. The agricultural competitiveness patterns by the RCA, the RTA, and the
NRCA are relatively different between the ASEAN countries and it is possible to
classify these countries into the strong, medium and weak agricultural competitive
groups. In general, Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia are in the strongest agricultural
competitive group with the largest number of agricultural competitive sectors and the
strong agricultural competitive sectors, high rankings of agricultural competitiveness;
Malaysia, Philippines, and Cambodia are in the medium agricultural competitive group;
while Singapore and Brunei are in the weak agricultural competitive group. The
ASEAN countries, in overall, achieve the strongest competitiveness in crop sectors,
                                           142



wood sectors, and fishery sectors such as rice, natural rubber, spices, fixed vegetable
fats and oils, wood in chips, fuel wood, fish, and crustaceans.
   The dynamics analysis by OLS regression indicates that these countries, generally,
have the convergent patterns in agricultural competitiveness except for Indonesia,
Cambodia, and Brunei. Indonesia has divergent or unidentified patterns of agricultural
competitiveness while the agricultural competitiveness patterns of Brunei and Cambodia
are not clear due to the unavailability of the full data. The dynamics analysis by Markov
matrix shows that Brunei, Cambodia, and Singapore have the highest mobility or strong
changes of agricultural competitiveness indicators; Vietnam and Philippines have the
relatively high stabilities or unchanges of agricultural competitiveness; while Malaysia,
Thailand, and Indonesia obtain the highest stability and the lowest mobility of
agricultural competitiveness. In general, the ASEAN countries successfully maintain the
rankings of the agricultural competitiveness over time.
   The results by the TCI, generally, imply that the ASEAN countries are weakly
complementary or strongly competing in the agricultural trade on the world markets. In
other words, the agricultural export patterns of the ASEAN countries weakly match the
agricultural import patterns of the partner countries in the ASEAN region in comparison
with the agricultural commodity composition of the word trade. In addition, the falling
trend of the mean TCI values shows that the agricultural complementarity degree of the
ASEAN countries slightly decreases over the period 1997-2015. In other words, the
ASEAN countries are becoming less complementary or more competing.
   The results by the ESI, however, show the low degree of similarity in the agricultural
export patterns of the ASEAN countries with the mean ESI value of 2.8. This means
that these countries are relatively complementary in exporting the agricultural products
to the world market. The different result between the TCI and the ESI indicates that the
ASEAN countries are not complementary in matching their partners’ agricultural import
demand while they are complementary in supplying agricultural products to the world
                                           143



markets. In other words, the countries will obtain more benefit from exporting their
agricultural products to the world markets rather than exporting to the ASEAN regional
markets. The growing trend of the mean ESI values shows that these countries are
becoming more competing on the world market.
   Spearman’s correlation coefficients for the competitiveness indicators, in general,
show that the ASEAN countries’ agricultural competitiveness patterns are relatively
substitutable or competing on the world markets. Singapore-Thailand, Brunei-Vietnam,
and Brunei-Thailand are the most complementary pairs of countries whilst Indonesia-
Philippines, Indonesia-Malaysia, and Thailand-Vietnam the most substitutable pairs in
the agricultural trade competitiveness patterns.
   In conclusion, though Vietnam has relatively strong competitiveness in agriculture it
is facing hard competitions from the regional countries such as Thailand and Indonesia
in both domestic and global markets. These competitions or substitutability in
agriculture seem to be increase over time. Therefore, the country should utilize its
strong competitive agricultural commodities such as wood in chips, spices, rice, natural
rubber, coffee, crustaceans, and fish to develop its market shares in the local and
regional markets. Moreover, Vietnam needs to enhance and take advantage of the
international economic relationships such as APEC, WTO, TPP-CPTPP, the ASEAN’s
relationships with India, Australia, China and bilateral trade agreements with United
States, Japan, Chile, Korea, Eurasian Economic Union, and European Communities to
expand its market shares on the world markets.
7.3 Competitiveness of alternative agricultural production systems in Ben Tre
   It is practically significant to identify the comparative advantages of competing
crops and theoretically original to compare the different competitiveness approaches.
This thesis fills in the research gap by assessing the alternative agricultural production
systems by the economics and production indicators in the case of Ben Tre. This case
study is an application of a policy analysis matrix to investigate the competitiveness of
                                            144



the three alternative crops of rice, coconut, and pomelo in the general arable lands of
Ben Tre province of Vietnam. The results, in general, indicate that pomelo achieves the
strongest comparative advantage with the PCR of 0.16, the DRC of 0.13, and the SCB
of 0.15, coconut obtains the medium comparative advantage the PCR of 0.53 and the
DRC of 0.38, and the SCB of 0.42 while rice has the weakest comparative advantage
with the PCR of 0.92, the DRC of 0.63, and the SCB of 0.71.
   The rice, coconut, and pomelo are not, generally, supported or protected by the
government with the NPCO values of 0.72, 0.59, and 0.69, respectively. These
agricultural production systems may obtain, however, the subsidy by the government
with the NPCI values of 0.85 for rice, 0.85 for coconut, and 0.86 for pomelo. The EPC
and PC values of rice, coconut, and pomelo are smaller than the unity and the results
indicate the net disincentives of the government for the rice, coconut, and pomelo
production systems. The study, moreover, confirms the overall transfers from the private
producers of rice, coconut, and pomelo sectors to the general society with the SRP
values of -0.25, -0.33, and -0.29, respectively. Especially, the social profit indicators are
higher than the private profit indicators. It means that the society obtains more benefits
from these agricultural production activities than the private actors. This result seems to
be different from the other countries, especially in OECD countries.
   The thesis, moreover, analyzes the sensitivity of the PAM indicators to understand
the dynamics of the comparative advantages of these crops by three scenarios. First, in
the case of the climate change of the drought and salinity intrusion in 2016 which cause
the yield reductions of rice and pomelo sectors while it slightly improves the
productivity of coconut sector. The result shows that it makes rice become non-
profitable at the market price while the sector is still weakly competitive at the social
price. The PAM indicators of coconut and pomelo seem to be changed insignificantly.
Second, if the rice, coconut, and pomelo private producers have to pay the water and
land charges the private rice producer will get loss while coconut and pomelo producers
                                            145



still obtain profit. The payments of the water and land charges to the government do not
impact on the PAM indicators at social prices. Finally, the sensitivity of the PAM
indicators to the assuming changes of output prices, fertilizer prices, land rent prices,
production productivity, and the real effective exchange rate by the scope of ±5, ±10,
±15 and ±20 percent. The results, generally, show that rice output price and productivity
decreases make the private producers get lost at the point of 10 percent only. All other
comparative advantage indicators at the private and social prices are stable in nature or
still in the interval {0, 1} with the assuming changes of the variables by that scope.
   In conclusion, rice is the weakest competitive and the most sensitive production
system to the changes in the climate and other market and policy conditions. Pomelo is
the strongest competitive and definitely stable production system to the changes of
market and policy conditions. Pomelo is, however, potential to be relatively impacted by
the climate change. Coconut is the medium competitive sector and relatively stable
production system to the changes in climate, market and policy conditions. Pomelo
results in the greatest private and social profits while coconut can generate a potential
coconut processing cluster with stable private and social profits. The results suggest that
rice arable land should be transferred into pomelo and coconut crops to achieve more
effective and sustainable results for private producer and society. However, the crop
transferring cost should be taken into account due to the big initial investments of
pomelo and coconut and the crop’s adaptations to the natural conditions.
   This thesis, however, has empirical limitations to identify the determinants or factors
of the agricultural competitiveness by using the econometric approach. The main
reasons are (i) the unavailability of data and variables at the sector level, namely at 3-
digit level in SITC Rev. 3. The national variables seem to not work for this regression
model; (ii) the main objective of this thesis is to investigate and compare the agricultural
competitiveness by the cross-sections analysis and the cross-countries analysis.
Therefore, the future research should try to identify the factors of the agricultural
                                          146



competitiveness in Vietnam in particular or in the many countries in general. The thesis
is also limited to using two methods of many approaches. Thus the future researches
need to employ and compare other frameworks of measuring competitiveness to
understand the different sides of agricultural competitiveness of Vietnam.
7.4 Theoretical analysis and conclusion
   The literature review concludes that there are various approaches to investigate the
competitiveness according to six main disciplines such as: (i) the economic and
production indicators; (ii) the trade performance indices; (iii) the determinants of
competitiveness; (iv) the multidimensional frameworks; (v) the value chain performance
approaches; and (vi) the benchmarking. In this thesis, the authors will employ the first
and second approaches to achieve the research objectives. This thesis contributes to the
economic literature by providing the evidences and discussions of the consistency of the
trade indices in cases of Vietnam and the ASEAN countries and the comparison of trade
and economic approaches in case of Ben Tre province.
   The consistency tests between the competitiveness indices of the RCA, the RTA, and
the NRCA in cases of Vietnam by cross-sections and the ASEAN countries by cross-
countries over the period 1997-2015 show that these trade indices are strongly
consistent as cardinal measures and dichotomous measures while they are weakly
consistent as ordinal measures. The RCA and the NRCA are perfectly consistent as
dichotomous measures due to the derivation of the NRCA from the neutral-point of the
RCA whilst they are the weakest consistent as ordinal measures. In other words, the
trade indices are strongly consistent in identifying the degrees of the agricultural
competitiveness and determining whether a country obtains the competitiveness in an
agricultural sector while they are weakly consistent in ranking the competitiveness.
   The PAM model consists of various indicators such as the PP, the PCR, the SP, the
DRC, the SCB, the NPC, the EPC, the PC, and the SRP to assess the comparative
advantages, the efficiency of agricultural production systems and the impacts of market
                                           147



failures and policy on agricultural production activities. The results show that the PAM
indicators seem to be inconsistent and contrary to the trade performance indices (the
RCA, the RTA, and the NRCA for these sectors of Vietnam) in the case study of Ben
Tre province for rice, coconut, and pomelo production systems. The potential
explanation is that the PAM indicators identify the social benefits and welfare. They are,
therefore, dependent on the output prices positively and the supply quantity negatively.
In other words, the higher output prices and less supply quantity may result in the
stronger competitiveness by the PAM indicators. On the other hand, the trade
performance indices measure the relative market shares and they are dependent on the
output prices negatively and the supply quantity positively. Thus, the higher output
prices and less supply quantity may result in the weaker competitiveness by the trade
performance indices. The PAM and trade performance approaches, in conclusion,
investigate the different perspectives of competitiveness based on the data sources, the
research and policy objectives and conditions. The PAM indicators employ the
production data to measure the comparative advantages of the agricultural production
systems based on the high output prices, high value-added, and low input costs to
generate the higher private and social profitability and welfare. On the other hand, the
trade performance indices use the revealed trade data to assess the comparative
advantages of the agricultural trade flows based the large export quantity, relative high
market shares, and low prices to improve the private and social profitability and welfare.
   This result is, however, limited in the scope of three sectors in one province in one
year to make the conclusion of the negative relationship between the PAM indicators
and the trade performance indices due to the limited data. Thus, the future research
should expand the scope of empirical research to identify the relationship between these
approaches if the necessary data is available. Moreover, it is worth noting that the PAM
and the trade based measures mainly focus on the outcomes of competitiveness only and
are not completely good at capturing the key competitiveness issues in an agricultural
                                          148



system or value chain. In other words, these approaches fail to provide the
understanding the natures or sources of these outcomes, to identify the determinants or
factors of the results, and to recognize the any bottlenecks or problems occurring in the
supply chain to improve the competitiveness. Thus the future research which may
provide the empirical studies and the comparison arguments between the approaches of
the economic and production indicators, the trade performance indices, the value chain
performances, benchmarking, and multidimensional models will be practically and
theoretically significant and useful.
7.5 Policy implications
   Though achieving the relative comparative advantages from the natural environment,
fertile soil, and abundant water resource, Vietnam’s agricultural sectors face the
problems of domination of small-scale farms, negative impact on the environment,
cultivation land conversion towards urbanization and industrialization, new challenges
from climate changes, increasing input costs, low productivity, the severe competitions,
and demanding markets. The results, in general, indicate that Vietnam’s agricultural
competitiveness pattern and export strategy are based on the primary and natural-
resource-intensive agricultural sectors with relatively low private and social
profitability, value-added, and welfare. The agricultural trade competitiveness patterns
are slightly changed and improved with the convergent trends in overall. The main
agricultural sectors have been, however, significantly losing the competitiveness over
time such as rice, crustaceans, fuel wood & wood charcoal, natural rubber, coffee, tea,
and silk. Vietnam obtains the relatively high agricultural competitiveness rankings in
comparison with other countries, especially the ASEAN countries. The ASEAN
countries seem to be relatively substitutable in the world agricultural markets and the
ASEAN countries’ competitions in agriculture tends to increase over time. The thesis,
moreover, assesses the competitiveness of alternative or competing agricultural
production systems in the arable lands to determine the best crops by economic
                                          149



indicators. The result shows that rice has the weakest competitiveness, coconut has the
medium competitiveness, and pomelo obtains the strongest competitiveness. Rice is also
strongly sensitive to the changes of input factors and the climate condition. Coconut is
relatively stable to the changes of these factors. Coconut and pomelo, however, require
the big initial investment over 3-5 year period without turnovers and incomes.
   Based on the research results, the thesis would suggest the general policy and
strategy implications to sustainably develop the agricultural sectors and improve the
private and social welfare in Vietnam as follows: (i) re-structuring the production and
trade pattern of Vietnam’s agricultural sector; (ii) maintaining the competitiveness
rankings of the key agricultural sectors; (iii) Expanding and enforcing the regional and
global integration; (iv) building the master crop plans; and (v) promoting sustainable
agriculture and adapting to climate changes.
Re-structuring the agricultural production and trade pattern
   In general, the primary and natural-resource-intensive agricultural production and
trade pattern may be important and appropriate in the initial period of economic
innovation and industrialization. The dynamics analysis also proves that Vietnam’s
export strategy and comparative advantage pattern is relatively dependent on the
natural-resource-intensive and traditional agricultural sectors such as crop and fishery
sectors over time. Though there are changes in the competitiveness rankings of the
strongest competitive commodities and the convergent pattern in the agricultural
competitiveness over the period 1997-2014 which may be considered as a small
improvement of the export and economic growth pattern, the natural-resource-intensive
and traditional products are the strongest competitive and main agricultural export
sectors of Vietnam. The natural-resource-intensive export strategy should be important
in the initial period of industrialization, economic development, and globalization but
not be appropriate and effective in the medium and long terms. Especially, in the current
process of globalization and modernization with the fierce competition and strict
                                           150



demand for food, Vietnam has to re-structure the agricultural production and trade
pattern to the large value-added and high productivity sectors based on the high
technology agricultural and modern management process.
   In order to re-structure the agricultural production and trade pattern, the country
should implement the following actions: (i) identifying the potential agricultural
commodities which are preferred by the consumers and suitable for the local natural
conditions based on the economic, social, and environmental indicators; (ii) planning
cultivated areas and transferring other products to these potential sectors with taking
account of the transforming cost and initial investment; (iii) employing high agricultural
technology and international quality standards; (iv) enhancing the horizontal and
vertical linkages in the sector; and (v) promoting the local and export markets.
Maintaining the rankings of strong competitiveness sectors
   The empirical results indicate that Vietnam has been losing competitiveness in its
key and strong competitiveness sectors such as rice, crustaceans, tea, rubber, silk, and
coffee. They are the most important sectors with significant contributions to Vietnamese
economy and society. Though Vietnam obtains the significant market shares and trade
competitiveness these commodities incur the low value-added and export price due to
product quality and added-value services such as package, private brand name,
standards, labels, and marketing and promoting activities.
   Developing the science, technology, and system management in agriculture are the
significant keys to improve the agricultural product quality and value. The science,
technology, and system management indicators may be measured by the number of
experts, research & development spending, capital and investment for agricultural
science, technology, and system management; share of agricultural production; science
and technology patents; science and technology infrastructures. The result in Chapter 4
shows that Vietnam science and technology indicators are generally lower than
Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Therefore, Vietnam’s government,
                                           151



enterprises, and farmers need to increase the investment and spending in the agricultural
science, technology, and system management.
   In conclusion, Vietnam may maintain the competitive advantage degrees and ranks
of these important agricultural sectors by: (i) identifying the key agricultural sectors
with the high quality and strong competitiveness to develop in large scales with the
efficient master plans; (ii) researching, preparing, and producing the good quality seeds
or varieties in the mass scopes; (iii) employing high technology, international quality
standards and production process; (iv) innovating the appearance of agricultural
products, packages, and labels; (v) promoting the private brand names and collective
brand names for these agricultural products; and (vi) researching and applying the
modern and effective processing and preserving science and technology to increase the
agricultural product values.
Expanding and enforcing the regional and global integration
   Vietnam is a member of the ASEAN. The region is expanding and enforcing its
cooperation scopes and degrees. The research results in Chapter 6 allow to recommend
that, in order to take advantage of the opportunities in the regional economic integration,
the ASEAN countries with strong agricultural competitiveness need to specialize in and
maintain the competitive advantage degrees and ranks of their important agricultural
sectors such as rice, natural rubber, spices, fixed vegetable fats and oils, wood in chips,
fuel wood, fish, and crustaceans by upgrading product quality standards, improving
production productivities, enhancing the global market linkages, and reducing the input
costs. The countries with weak agricultural competitiveness such as Singapore and
Brunei should specialize in the processed and high-value agricultural sectors based on
their modern technology and abundant capital.
   The ASEAN countries, however, seem to be relatively substitutable in agricultural
products. The study, generally, suggests that the ASEAN countries should cooperate to
take advantage of their economic resources and internal markets as a “common
                                           152



domestic” market to enhance the competitiveness and predominantly focus on the
external markets based on the global trade and economic agreements and partnerships of
the association and the member countries such as the RCEP, the TPP-CPTPP, and their
bilateral free trade agreements. Moreover, the ASEAN countries should specialize in
producing and exporting the agricultural products with comparative advantages and
import the uncompetitive products to enhance the regional trades, effectively utilize
their economic resources, and create higher social welfare based on the elimination of
import and export restrictions and the reduction in production subsidies.
   Vietnam is a member of the ASEAN country. The country’s agricultural trade
pattern is relatively complementary to Brunei, Philippines, and Indonesia whilst it is
competing with Thailand, Cambodia, and Singapore in agricultural products. Therefore,
Vietnam should take advantage of the agricultural markets of Brunei, Philippines, and
Indonesia by the agricultural commodities with the comparative advantages. The
country, however, should cooperate with Thailand, Cambodia, and Singapore to develop
the external markets and avoid the competition in the regional market, especially
Vietnam’s local market. Moreover, China (including Hong Kong), the U.S., Japan,
India, EU, Korea, and Australia are the biggest agricultural markets. Thus, Vietnam,
cooperating with the ASEAN countries, should enhance the stronger partnership (such
as the RCEP, the TPP- CPTPP), expand the general and bilateral free trade agreements
to enhance the greater trade flows to the global markets.
Building the agricultural production master plans
   The incomes and livings of the farmers depend on the profits of their crops. In turn,
the profits are impacted by the price and quantity of the products. The questions are
what crops to choose, why to choose the crops, and how to transfer the crops?
Responding to these questions require the farmers, the policy makers, and the
enterprises to have the reference indicators which may capture the various components
and perspectives in the studied cases. The agricultural competitiveness indicators by the
                                           153



PAM model may significantly satisfy the issues in the case of Ben Tre of Vietnam. The
research results measuring the alternative agricultural production systems in chapter 7
show that rice has the weakest comparative advantage by the PAM indicators while it
obtains the strongest competitiveness by the trade indices. On the contrary, pomelo
obtains the strongest comparative advantage by the PAM indicators while it has the
weakest competitiveness by the trade indices. Coconut obtains the medium comparative
advantage by both approaches. Moreover, coconut supplies materials to generate a
strong coconut processing cluster in Ben Tre province. Especially, coconut crop may
effectively adapt to the changes in climates and other natural conditions. As the results,
it is essential to build the agricultural production master plans to increase the incomes
and social welfares of farmers sustainably based on the competitiveness indicators with
the following process: (i) identifying and selecting the strategic and potential
agricultural products in the studied areas; (ii) fulfilling a comprehensive competitiveness
report of these selected agricultural sectors with the consideration of transferring costs.
The report needs to adequately capture the economic, social, and environmental
perspectives and components; (iii) planning the areas, quantities, varieties, and
cultivation models of the crops which are suitable for the natural and market conditions;
(iv) regulating and supporting these famers to transfer or develop the selected crops by
training, cooperating, and input and output supports; and (v) linking these farmers to the
local and global markets by the contract farming and effective value chains.
Promoting sustainable agriculture and adapting to climate changes
   The result in Chapter 7 shows that the climate change of the drought and salinity
intrusion in the Mekong Delta will decrease the agricultural competitiveness by
reducing the productivity of the sectors such as rice and pomelo. Moreover, the land
degradation caused by overusing pesticide, fertilizers, and other inputs can relatively
impact on the agricultural productivity and the agricultural competitiveness as the result,
especially in the long term (Bernal et al., 2012). It is estimated that by 2080 the cereal
                                           154



production may be decreased by about 2-4 percent and the price will increase by 13-45
percent. Vietnam is among the countries which are predicted to be the most impacted by
the climate change due to its long coastline, high concentration of population and
economic activities in coastal and river areas, and the strong dependence on the
agriculture, natural resources, and forestry (Tran, 2011).
   In general, climate change includes the scenarios of temperature increase, rainfall
pattern change, sea level rise, drought, flooding, and salinity intrusion and it is
recognized as the global issue. The possible effects of the climate change on agriculture
consist of (1) impacts on agro-meteorology; (2) impacts on crop growth rate; (3)
impacts on crop water demand; (4) impacts on growth and spread of detrimental pests;
(5) impacts on growing seasons; (6) impacts on crop geographic distribution; (7)
impacts of sea-level rise; (8) impacts on rice and maize output; and (9) impacts on
animal husbandry (FAO, 2011). The climate change adaptation of agriculture, therefore,
will result in various benefits such as keeping policy relevant, informing mitigation
targets, informing investment, rewarding early adopters, and focusing on climate risk
management (Howden et al., 2007). Bryan et al. (2013) find out that who are more
likely to adopt new practices and adapt to climate changes are wealthier households.
Thus, it is necessary to predict the scenarios of the climate changes in each agricultural
areas of Vietnam specifically and estimate the possible impacts of the scenarios or
events on the agricultural productions. The results of the prediction and estimation will
be the background for adapting the agriculture to the climate changes. The potential
solutions to adapting the agriculture to the climate changes may be reviewed and
suggested as follows (Howden et al., 2007; Anwar et al., 2013; Ignaciuk, 2015):
   In the short term: The solutions in the short term aim to mitigate the negative
impacts of the climate changes and manage the risks at farm levels (i) Employing the
new or modified farming techniques and processes: altering the inputs and varieties,
adjusting farming management, diversifying the agricultural systems, changing land-use
                                            155



practices, adapting livestock management as a response to episodes of poor crop yields,
and adapting strategies for improved nutrient and pest control management; (ii)
Forecasting the climate, estimating the impacts, and developing the model to reduce
production risk; (iii) Improving risk management systems: insurance, forecasting, and
income diversification; (iv) Information dissemination and Extension services and
monitoring; and (v) Policy and public investment.
   In the medium term to the long term: The short term initiatives will affect the design
and content of the medium term to long term solutions. The farmers should alleviate the
impacts of the climate change quickly before the medium term to long term solutions
are fulfilled effectively. The possible measures to decrease to serious vulnerability to the
impacts of climate change which are anticipated in the medium term to long term can be
as follows: (i) Modeling and forecasting climate changes in the medium term to long
term; (ii) Simulating agricultural techniques that allow scaling up knowledge from gene
to cell to organisms and finally to the management systems; (iii) Empowering the
relation between weather forecasters, policy makers, and extension agents to ensure
suitable farm-level responses in the field to climate change; (iv) Investing the
infrastructures such as transportation system, storage and preservation systems,
irrigation and other water management, land-use management; and (v) Public policy and
public investment initiatives for developing of science and technology.

                                   APPENDICES
Appendices of the literature review of measuring framework for competitiveness
Appendix 1: Determinants of competitiveness
   The econometric regression of competitiveness values, the correlations, and ranks
are the popular and important methods to identify the determinants of competitiveness.
These approaches, however, require large numbers of explanatory variable data which
are not available in many countries and at many levels. Competitiveness may be
analyzed and determined at both macro-level such as gross production, national
productivity, added value, and trade (Naude, 2000; Makki et al.1999; Ball et al., 2001;
Yee et al., 2004; Rao et al., 2005; Lissitsa and Odening, 2005) and analyzed and
determined at micro-level such as farm productivity, household income, farms size,
technical efficiency, and profit (Davidova et al., 2003; Zhengfei and Lansink, 2006;
Davidova and Latruffe, 2007; Balcombe et al., 2008; Bojnec and Latruffe, 2009).
   The classical approach to strategy creation starts with an appraisal of organizational
competencies and resources which are distinctive or superior relative to the competitors,
may become the ground for competitive advantage if they are matched effectively to
environmental opportunities (Peteraf, 1993). The resource-based view is one of the most
widely recognized and employed theoretical framework                for explaining the
sustainable competitive advantage of a firm in the strategic management field (Powell,
2001; Newbert, 2007) and the competitive advantage lies on both valuable tangible and
intangible resources from the firm (Wernerfelt, 1984). Enterprises utilize their resources
to develop, produce and bring goods to their clients with a higher advantage in
comparison with their competitors (Barney, 1995). The resources can be defined as
drivers or determinants in identifying their impacts on firms’ competitive advantage
(Avella et al., 2001). There are many empirical studies using the resource-based view
approach to explain the factors of competitiveness at firm and sector level such as Collis
(1991), Gordon et al. (2005), Tuan and Yoshi (2010), Terziovski (2010), Solvell (2015).
                                            30




   At firm and sector levels, the five forces model to shape strategy is formulated by
Porter (1979) based on the industrial organization and firm resource theories. Porter
explains that in the fight for market share, competition is not only demonstrated in rivals
but in its underlying economics such as customers (bargaining power of customers),
suppliers (bargaining power of suppliers), potential entrants (threat of new entrants), and
substitute products (threat of substitute products or services). These forces impact on
and determine the profitability and competitiveness of a firm or a sector. The model is
flexibly used with modification in empirical studies such as Mathooko and Ogutu
(2015), Yunna and Yisheng (2014), Wu et al. (2012), Galbreath and Galvin (2008),
Smith (2007), Karagiannopoulos et al. (2005), Song et al. (2002), and Kim and
Michelman (1990). Dobbs (2014) reviews the literature, modifies, and provides a
comprehensive template for applying Porter’s five-force model for industry analysis.
   Porter (1990a, 1998), moreover, develops the diamond model to assess the national
competitive advantage at the country level. The framework explains why a country
obtains the competitive advantage in an industry and that country should specialize in
producing the commodity. The scholar illustrates that a country, like a company,
competes in international markets for its fair share of the world markets. At the country
level, there are two schools of thought on the country competitiveness: (i) the economic
school, that declines the concept of the country competitiveness, (ii) and the
management school, that supports the concept of the competitiveness at the country
level. The competitive advantage of a nation requires developing the cluster of domestic
sectors and factors which are advantageous and linked together. There are four
determinants of competitive advantage in Port’s framework which are: (i) factor
condition, (ii) demand condition, (iii) related and supporting industries, and (v) firm
strategy, structure and rivalry. The government and chance are two residual factors of
the national competitive advantage which impact on the four attributes above.
                                            31




   This model is exploited widely to identify the determinants and measure the
competitiveness at national, regional and sectorial levels. Bridwell and Richard (1998)
analyze the semiconductor industry based on Porter's model on the importance of
national industry related clusters and predict that “the entrepreneurial characteristics of
American companies would lead them to significant market share increases and that
Japanese businesses will lose market share to other Asian companies, particularly in
South Korea”. Oz (2002) employs the model to identify the sources of the competitive
advantage of Turkey and assess the framework in case of a developing country. The
result indicates that the diamond model is generally effective in a developing country.
The determinants of domestic rivalry and the role of government, however, seem to be
opposite to Porter’s hypothesis in some case studies of Turkey. Jasimuddin (2001)
demonstrates Porter’s model for the case study of identifying the success and
competitiveness of Arabia based on the oil sector with the help of the sectors of gas,
chemicals, machinery, and banking. He suggests that the future studies may be
accomplished by combining with SWOT matrix and the model is not contradictory but,
rather, supplementary to Porter’s analysis. Clancy et al. (2001) investigate the role of
industrial clusters and the elements of Porter’s diamond model in the case of the small
open economy of Ireland. They do not discover the proofs of developed clusters of the
type reported by Porter and conclude that Irish industrial policy is not necessary to be
focused on developing the type of industry clusters in the model. Bridwell and Kuo
(2005) use the Diamond model to analyze the competitiveness of computer sector in
China and Taiwan. They conclude that the combination of resources or forces from the
mainland China and other overseas Chinese from Taiwan, Singapore, and those who
have worked for high technology companies in the US could become an even more
powerful force in the global computer industry of the future. Dogl et al. (2012)
investigate the competitive advantage of German renewable energy firms in India and
China by using the diamond model that is modified and specified for the renewable
                                             32




energy sector. The study indicates that general demand for renewable energies in India
and China is significant but different from biomass, solar and wind energy. There are
empirical studies employing Porter’s model in different industries and countries such as
Jarungkitkul and Sukcharoensin (2016), Wilson et al. (2014), Rajasekar and Raee
(2013), Herciu (2013), Zang (2012), and Mehrizi and Pakneiat (2008).
   Singh et al. (2015) identify the key determinants for enhancing competitiveness by
using the descriptive research design by statistical tools with a self-structured
questionnaire. The determinants includes the threat of new competition, the threat of
substitute products or services, the bargaining power of suppliers, the intensity of
competitive rivalry, the bargaining power of customers, and the rivalry among existing
firms based on the competitive advantage diamond model of Porter (1990a). The
authors confirm that the threat of new competition and threat of substitutes/services
emerge as the important predictors. The intensity of competitive rivalry, preparedness
for competition, and bargaining power of suppliers also emerge as significant predictors.
The variables explain 79.6 percent of the variation in the model. The Porter’s model of
national competitiveness, moreover, has various critiques in general. Thus, it been
modified and adjusted by scholars to capture more factors or resources of the national
competitive advantage and to be applied to small, open, trading economies in both
business and economic theories (Smith, 2010; Jin and Moon 2006; Moon et al., 1995;
Cho, 1994; Rugman and D’Cruz, 1993; Burnell and Sheppard, 1992; Grant, 1991).
Appendix 2: Multidimensional frameworks
   Nowadays competitiveness has become a key economic feature both in policy and in
academic. While there is much agreement on the economic and social importance of
competitiveness, it is less clear and generally accepted what its components,
perspectives, and indicator are (Martin, 2003) and single dimension and approach
measures are not able to capture all elements of the concepts at all levels (Buckley et al.,
1988). The multi-dimensional and multi-perspective frameworks have been proposed to
                                            33




measure the competitiveness at sectorial, regional, and national levels such as the
Vietnam provincial competitiveness index (PCI), the Vietnam competitiveness report
(Ketels et al., 2010), the global competitiveness report (WEF), the global travel &
tourism report (WEF), the world competitiveness yearbook (IMD), the urban
competitiveness reports (Ni, 2012), and the national competitiveness (Kao et al., 2008).
   The PCI on Vietnam’s business background conducts an annual survey, analyzing
and ranking of the economic governance quality of provincial authorities in generating a
favorable business environment for the development of the private sector. The general
PCI consists of ten sub-indices, indicating economic governance fields impacting on the
private sector development. A province that is seen to perform well on the PCI is the
one that has: 1) low entry costs for business start-up; 2) easy access to land and security
of business premises; 3) transparent business environment and equitable business
information; 4) minimal informal charges; 5) limited time requirements for bureaucratic
procedures and inspections; 6) limits crowding out of private activity from policy biases
toward state, foreign, or connected firms; 7) proactive and creative provincial leadership
in solving problems for enterprises; 8) developed and high-quality business support
services; 9) the sound labor training policies; and 10) the fair and effective legal
procedures for dispute resolution. The index is constructed in a three-step sequence:
(i) collecting the primary data and secondary data, (ii) computing ten sub-indices and
standardizing to a 10-point scale, and (iii) calibrating the composite PCI as the weighted
mean of ten sub-indices with a maximum score of 100 points (PCI, 2017).
   The Vietnam Competitiveness Report (Ketels et al., 2010) is based on the
competitiveness framework of Porter (1990) to develop a new model for Vietnamese
national competitiveness. The authors build the framework to identify the determinants
of national competitiveness at microeconomic and microeconomic levels and the
endowments. They develop the framework measuring the competitiveness with three
key categories of indicators providing the different perspectives of Vietnam’s economic
                                            34




environment and competitiveness position: (i) the first group of indicators provides an
assessment of the economic performance; (ii) the second group of indicators includes
intermediate indicators of economic activity; (iii) the third group tracks Vietnam’s
position on the broad range of macro- and micro-economic competitiveness
fundamentals presenting the economic results.
   The world economic forum (WEF, 2017) defined competitiveness “as the set of
institutions, policies, and factors that determine the level of productivity of an economy,
which in turn sets the level of prosperity that the country can achieve”. The productivity
level also affects the rates of return obtained by investments in an economy, which in
turn are the fundamental determinants of its growth rates. In other words, a more
competitive economy is one that is likely to change over time. The WEF, based on
Klaus Schwab’s original idea of 1979, has published the global competitiveness index
(GCI) built by Xavier Sala-i-Martín in collaboration with the Forum since 2005. The
index integrates 114 and these indicators are grouped into 12 pillars: Pillar 1:
institutions; Pillar 2: infrastructure; Pillar 3: macroeconomic environment; Pillar 4:
health and primary education; Pillar 5: higher education and training; Pillar 6: goods
market efficiency; Pillar 7: labor market efficiency; Pillar 8: financial market
development; Pillar 9: technological readiness; Pillar 10: market size; Pillar 11: business
sophistication; Pillar 12: and innovation. These pillars are in turn classified into three
sub-indexes:   basic   requirements,    efficiency   enhancers,    and   innovation    and
sophistication factors. The three sub-indexes are given different weights in the
calculation of the overall Index, depending on each economy’s stage of development, as
proxied by its GDP per capita and the share of exports represented by raw materials
(WEF, 2017).
   To measure the impact of sustainability on economic competitiveness, the WEF
proposes the analytical framework of the sustainable competitiveness index (SCI). The
index takes a long-term approach to highlight factors that could represent vulnerabilities
                                            35




to national competitiveness and productivity in the future. The WEF defines sustainable
competitiveness as “the set of institutions, policies, and factors that make a nation
productive over the longer term while ensuring social and environmental sustainability.
Social sustainability, in turn, is defined as the institutions, policies, and factors that
enable all members of society to experience the best possible health, participation, and
security; and that maximize their potential to contribute to and benefit from the
economic prosperity of the country in which they live. And we define environmental
sustainability as the institutions, policies, and factors that ensure an efficient
management of resources to enable prosperity for present and future generations”. The
SCI is calculated from the Global Competitiveness Index adjusted by factors that
encompass social and environmental sustainability (WEF, 2015).
   The social sustainability pillar consists of three categories: (1) population’s access to
basic necessities: access to sanitation, access to improved drinking water, access to
healthcare services; (2) population’s vulnerability to economic exclusion: vulnerable
employment as a percentage of total employment, the extent of the informal economy,
and social safety net protection; and (3) social cohesion: the income Gini index, social
mobility, and youth unemployment (WEF, 2015).
   The WEF, additionally, develops the multi-dimensional competitiveness framework
for travel and tourism (TTCI) sectors at country level. The TTCI identifies “the set of
factors and policies that enable the sustainable development of the Travel & Tourism
sector, which, in turn, contributes to the development and competitiveness of a country”
(Crotti and Misrahi, 2017). The index measures four broad determinants of
competitiveness. These factors are classified into sub-indexes, which are further
grouped into 14 pillars. Sub-index 1: The enabling environment sub-index, capturing the
general settings necessary for operating in a country, consists of (1) business
environment, (2) safety and security, (3) health and hygiene, (4) human resources and
labor market, (5) ICT readiness. Sub-index 2: The travel and tourism policy and
                                            36




enabling conditions sub-index, covering the specific policies or strategic aspects that
impact the travel and tourism industry more directly, consists of (6) prioritization of
travel and tourism, (7) international openness, (8) price competitiveness, (9)
environmental sustainability. Sub-index 3: The infrastructure sub-index, indicating the
availability and quality of physical infrastructure of each economy, consists of (10) air
transport infrastructure, (11) ground and port infrastructure, (12) tourist service
infrastructure. Sub-index 4: The natural and cultural resources sub-index, presenting the
principal reasons and motivations to travel, consists of (13) natural resources, (14)
cultural resources and business travel (Crotti and Misrahi, 2017).
   The IMD world competitiveness yearbook - WCY (Bris, 2014) evaluates and ranks
the ability of nations to produce and sustain an environment which maintains the
competitiveness of enterprises. The authors assume that wealth creation takes place
primarily at enterprise level and it is considered as the competitiveness of enterprises.
The enterprises operate in a national environment which enhances their capacity to
compete in local or foreign markets and it is called the competitiveness of nations and is
captured by the WCY. The WCY framework divides the national environment into four
main factors: (i) economic performance; (ii) government efficiency; (iii) business
efficiency; and (iv) infrastructure. In turn, each of the factors is grouped into 5 sub-
factors which emphasize every aspect of the areas under study. The WCY features 20
sub-factors totally. There are 338 criteria in the 20 sub-factors and each sub-factor might
not have the same number of criteria. Each sub-factor has the same weight in the overall
consolidation of result that is 5 percent (20x5 =100) (Bris, 2014).
   Criteria may be hard data analyzing competitiveness as it can be measured or soft
data measuring competitiveness as it can be perceived. Hard criteria constitute a weight
of 2/3 in the overall ranking whilst the survey data constitute a weight of 1/3. Some
criteria, in addition, are for basic information only, this means that they are not used in
computing the overall competitiveness ranking. Finally, aggregating the results of the 20
                                             37




sub-factors makes the total consolidation leading to the overall ranking of the WCY
(Bris, 2014; Institute for Management Development, 2014).
   The center for city and competitiveness (CASS) publishes the global urban
competitiveness report. The conceptual framework of the index includes the urban
competitiveness    mechanism,      the   urban    competitiveness    outcome,     the   urban
competitiveness process, and the urban competitiveness input (determinants). The
CASS defines “Urban competitiveness is the ability to attract factors, utilize
environment, develop industry, produce products, provide service, capture the market,
and create the largest fortunes in a fast, effective manner and supply welfare to citizens
in the process of competition, cooperation and development in the comparison with
other cities. Among them, providing benefits for the residents is the ultimate goal of
urban competitiveness” (Ni, 2012). The center explains that cities are dissimilar in the
environments, causing the distinction in comparative advantage between cities, and the
difference in industry and specialization between regions. The different factor
environments bring about various value chains and value creating, which in return
influence cities’ resources, factors and environment. Therefore, not only the division of
labor, cooperation and commerce can be seen among cities, complicated competition
also exists. The urban competitiveness outcome can be measured by city value profit.
The city value profit situation is a dimensional and comprehensive concept, including
profit quality, profit scale, profit efficiency, profit growth rate and growth sustainability.
The model urban competitiveness outcome index comprises: (i) economic scale (ES);
(ii) economic efficiency (EE); (iii) economic growth (EG); (iv) economic quality (EQ);
(v) exterior effect (IE) and; (vi) economic density (ED).
   The enterprises generate the city’s value. Therefore, the level of industry system
made up of enterprises determines the level of entire value system. The industry system
is established by many industries, which further segments into departments and links
with enterprises. Industry system may not only represent the categories of industries in a
                                               38




region but connection among industries both interior and exterior. This is called urban
competitiveness process. The CASS suggests the model of urban competitiveness
determinants based on Porter's national competitiveness model. The model consists of
seven factors: (i) enterprises quality (QE); (ii) local environment (LE); (iii) local
demands (LD); (iv) local connection (LC); (v) global connection (GC); (vi) public
institutions (PI) and; (vii) local infrastructure (LI).
   According to Kao et al. (2008), the concept of national competitiveness is a measure
of the relative ability of a country to generate and sustain an environment in which
enterprises can compete so that the prosperity level can be improved. They propose a
framework for measuring the national competitiveness and apply for the ASEAN
countries. The authors confirm that the complicated system of national competitiveness
cannot be assessed directly, it is necessary to deconstruct it into subsystems of
manageable size. The first level comprises four primary factors: economy, technology,
human resource, and management. Each primary factor is constituted of 16 secondary
factors and there are 116 criteria in these secondary factors.
   SolAbility yearly publishes the global sustainable competitiveness index – GSCI that
has goals to assess the “ability of countries to create and sustain wealth that does not
negatively affect the underlying fundament of wealth creation, based on the definition of
Sustainable Development”. The GSCI captures all aspects that make economies lasting
successful and is not limited commonly used financial factors. The index is based on a
competitiveness model that incorporates all pillars of sustained growth and wealth
creation: natural capital availability; national governance; intellectual capital; resource
efficiency, and social cohesion. SolAbility (2017) defines “sustainable competitiveness
is the ability to generate and sustain inclusive wealth without diminishing future
capability of sustaining or increasing current wealth levels”.
   The sustainable competitiveness index is a three-dimensional model that reconciles
the economy, the environment, and the society. The GSCI is based on 109 quantitative
                                           39




performance indicators which are grouped into the 5 pillars of sustainable
competitiveness: (i) the natural capital: water, forest and biodiversity indicators,
agricultural indicators, land degradation and desertification, minerals and energy
resources, pollution indicators and depletion indicators; (ii) the resource management:
water usage and intensity, energy usage, intensity and energy sources, climate change
emissions and intensity as well as certain raw material usage; (iii) the social capital:
health performance indicators, birth statistics, income differences, equal opportunities,
freedom of press, human rights considerations, the level of crime against both
possession and humans, and perceived levels of well-being and happiness; (iv) the
intellectual capital: education levels, R&D performance indicators, infrastructure
investment levels, employment indexes, and the balance of the agricultural-industrial-
service sectors; and (v) the governance: infrastructure, business legislation, level of
corruption, government investments, exposure to business and volatility risks, exposure
to financial risks.
Appendix 3: Value chain performance approaches
   The concept of value chain describes the full range of activities which are required to
bring a product or service from conception, through the intermediary phases of
production and delivery to final consumers (Kaplinsky, 1999). Initially, the “filière”
approach (filière means chain) is used to analyze contract farming and vertical
integration in French agriculture in the 1960s and is applied in parallel to agricultural
systems under the French colonial system (M4P, 2008). The “filière” framework
focuses on how local production is linked to processing, trading, exporting, and end-
consuming. The initial approach mainly focuses on physical and quantitative technical
relationship. In theoretical and practical studies, there are two similar concepts of the
value chain and the supply chain. These concepts are slightly different at individual and
management level of firm analysis while they become homogeneous at macro and
                                             40




economic level of chain and sector analysis. The authors do not distinguish the value
chain and supply chain concepts in this thesis.
   Porter (1985) develops two value chain models to assess how a company should
position itself in the market and in the relationship with suppliers, buyers, and
competitors to improve its competitive advantage. His first approach focuses on internal
activities of a firm and second approach is devoted to direct suppliers and buyers. Value
chain concept has been expanded to global scale. Gereffi and Korzeniewicz (1994) and
Kaplinsky (1999) use the value chain framework to examine the ways in which firms or
countries are globally integrated and assess the determinants of the global income
distribution. Value chain analysis is reasonably flexible and the tool can help to design
projects or programs to provide support to a value chain, or set of value chains, in order
to achieve the desired development outcome (M4P, 2008). A pro-poor approach
analysis framework of the value chain has been developed by M4P (2008) to make
value chain work better for the poor. The objectives are first to assess the general
performance of the value chains and sectors, to increase the total amount and value
which the poor people in the value chain sell and obtain, and last to increase the margin
rate per product of the poor people in comparison with other actors.
   Kaplinsky and Morris (2001) emphasize that there is no general correct way to
conduct value chain in all cases. The approach depends on the research question and
objective. However, there are four important aspects of agricultural value chain
analysis: (i) mapping the actors and their activities in the value chain systematically; (ii)
identifying the benefit distribution of actors in the value chain; (iii) examining the role
of upgrading within the value chain; and (iv) highlighting the role of governance in the
chain. Apart from value chain analysis, value chain upgrading for development is an
important step. Firms or actors can adopt four trajectories including process upgrading,
product upgrading, function upgrading, or chain upgrading (Kaplinsky and Morris,
                                             41




2001). M4P (2008), especially, explains the options of demand-driven upgrading
strategies with four factors of knowledge, skills, technology, and supporting services.
   It is also argued that an efficient value chain would normally reduce the use of
intermediaries in the chain, and strengthen value-added activities as result of better
technology and inputs, farming procurement, upgraded infrastructure, improved price
opportunities through demand-driven production, and secure food processing and
exports (Miller and Jones, 2010).
   The financial or quantitative analysis is one of the most important steps in value
chain analysis. M4P (2008) approach emphasizes the importance of revenue, cost,
value-added, and profit. FAO (2005) and Springer-Heinze (2007) stress total value or
revenue (Y), intermediate cost (IC), and added value (VA). In addition, FAO (2005)
employs both market price and shadow price to analyze financial efficiency indicators
such as economic growth, income distribution, and financial impact.
   According to Humphrey and Schmitz (2002), four types of value chain upgrading
are identified in a global value chain framework as follows: (i) product upgrading:
moving into more sophisticated products; (ii) process upgrading: transforming the inputs
into the outputs more efficiently due to production system and superior technology; (iii)
functional upgrading: developing new functions and abandoning existing functions to
improve the activities; and (iv) chain upgrading: moving into new but often related
sectors. Gereffi (2005), moreover, adds the economic upgrading which specifically is
defined as a transition (i) to the higher value-added activities in production, (ii) to the
better improved technology, knowledge and skills, and (iii) to the more increased
benefits or profits deriving from participation in the value chain. Trienekens (2011)
proposes a value chain framework for developing countries consisting of three
components: (i) value chain constraint: market information and access, resources and
infrastructure, and institutions; (ii) value chain analysis: value-added, network structure,
                                             42




and government forms; and (iii) value chain upgrading: options for upgrading such as:
value-added, network position, government, and partnerships.
   The complexity is that value chain actors encounter the conflicting goals and
benefits along the chain. Each individual actor has different goals, performance
indicators, and the optimization criteria. Therefore, an adequate and integrated
performance measurement system needs to be proposed to measure the success of value
chain (Aramyan et al., 2007). The performance framework should represent both
effectiveness and efficiency of the value chain in general and its actors in particular.
Van der Vorst (2000) classifies the performance indicators into three levels: (i) the
supply chain level (e.g. product availability, quality, responsiveness, delivery reliability
and total supply chain costs); (ii) the organization level (e.g. inventory level, throughput
time, responsiveness, delivery reliability and total organizational costs); and (iii) the
process level (e.g. responsiveness, throughput time, process yield and process costs). Li
and O’Brien (1999) proposed a model to improve supply chain efficiency and
effectiveness based on four criteria such as profit, lead-time performance, delivery
promptness, and waste elimination. The supply chain operations reference (SCOR)
model of the supply chain council (merged with APICS since 2014) provides the
process indicators of the supply chain performances such as plan, source, make, deliver,
return, enable and metrics indicators such as perfect order fulfillment, order fulfillment
cycle time, upside supply chain flexibility, upside supply chain adaptability, downside
supply chain adaptability, overall value at risk, total cost to serve, cash-to-cash cycle
time, return on supply chain fixed assets, and return on working capital (APICS, 2017).
Lai et al. (2002) differentiate three dimensions of value chain performance as follows:
(i) service effectiveness for shippers; (ii) operational efficiency; and (iii) service
effectiveness for consignees. The scholars identify four performance indicators of a
value chain such as: (i) responsiveness; (ii) reliability; (iii) costs; and (iv) assets.
Beamon (1998, 1999a,b) proposes the system of three dimensions: (i) resources (i.e.
                                             43




efficiency of operations); (ii) output (i.e. high level of customer service); and (iii)
flexibility (ability to respond to a changing environment).
   Aramyan et al. (2006, 2007) propose a conceptual framework for assessing the
performance of agri-food supply chains based on a literature review of existing
performance indicators for supply chains that performance indicator model can be used
at the organizational level as well as the supply chain level. The framework’s indicators
are grouped into four main factors: (1) efficiency; (2) flexibility; (3) responsiveness; and
(4) food quality. Each of factors includes different sub-indicators.
   Gorton et al. (2013) comprehensively review the theoretical and empirical studies in
the agri-food competitiveness and note that most of the literature regarding agri-food
industry competitiveness draws mainly on trade, productivity and value-added
indicators and concentrates on the assessment of competitiveness at the farm level, with
very few studies employing a fully integrated supply chain approach. The authors
develop a conceptual framework for analyzing sustainable competitiveness of
agricultural product value chain based on a set of indicators which are required to be (1)
comprehensive, (2) illuminating, (3) verifiable, (4) usable, and (5) comparable. The
model comprises 5 factors: (i) the relationships between agents and domains; (ii) the
sphere of enterprise such as farms, food manufacturers and retailers; (iii) the customers
such as prices, safety, wellbeing and satisfaction; (iv) the policymakers and government;
and (v) the natural environment such as biodiversity, climate (Gorton et al., 2013)
Appendix 4: Benchmarking
   According to Zairi (1994a), there are two important stages which need to be adhered
to if any benchmarking exercise is to prove successful and 16 steps to implement
benchmarking. The effectiveness stage includes step 1 to step 7: (1) understand internal
processes; (2) evaluate current processes; (3) identify process limitations/opportunities
for improvement; (4) improve processes (5) measure and evaluate; (6) set internal
standards; (7) control and manage processes. The competitiveness stage consists of step
                                            44




8 to step 16: (8) select process suitable for benchmarking; (9) identify suitable partners;
(10) agree on measurement strategy (11) compare standards; (12) understand why
difference in performance (13) change relevant practices for improving performance
(14) compare standards (15) repeat experience with same/new partners on regular basis;
and (16) apply benchmarking to all processes.
   Rigby (2007) suggests the benchmarking process involving the following 6 steps: (1)
select a product, service or process to benchmark; (2) identify the key performance
metrics; (3) choose companies or internal areas to benchmark; (4) collect data on
performance and practices; (5) analyze the data and identify opportunities for
improvement; and (6) adapt and implement the best practices, setting reasonable goals
and ensuring company-wide acceptance. Ribeiro and Cabral (2006) summarize and
describe benchmarking as a structured process in the continuous improvement cycle: (1)
planning (plan): decide what will be part of the benchmarking exercise and who will
contribute to it; (2) information collecting (do) in order to establish the comparison
basis; (3) analysis of the gaps (check) between the enterprise and its partners; and (4)
adoption or implementation (act) of changes in the enterprise in order to straighten out
the situation. Stapenhurst (2009), in the best guidebook of benchmarking, proposes a
basic model of benchmarking with three phases as follows: Phase 1. Planning:
identifying the need to benchmark and approving the detailed proposal with a plan;
Phase 2. Benchmarking performance: recruiting and working with participants,
collecting and comparing data, issuing report; and Phase 3. Improvement: using the
information in the reports to identify specific improvement areas and tasks, completing
the improvement activity by any appropriate method.
   There are various benchmarking indicators in practice and literature, depending on
the purposes and focus of the benchmarking process. Rao et al. (2006) define the
environmental performance indicators as materials, energy, water, waste, EMI, and
training/staff. Al-Najjar (2004) explains the benchmarking indicators of furniture
                                             45




maintenance performance as (1) simple to understand and implement, (2) applicable in
different circumstances, (3) informative enough so that it is possible to judge the
situation and trace the basic reasons behind deviations, (4) cost-effective, (5) sensitive to
changes in maintenance performance and manufacturing process, (6) not easily
influenced by disturbing factors, and (7) representative. Cassell et al. (2001) analyze
enterprises using and benefitting from the benchmarking indices including financial
performance, customer satisfaction, quality of products, marketing information,
employee training, product innovation, communication, job satisfaction, attitudes to
quality, process innovation, team spirit, and stress levels. Feil et al. (2015) review the
empirical studies and identify 77 benchmarking indicators, including 37 environmental
sustainability indicators, 31 social indicators; and 9 economic indicators. Anderson and
McAdam (2005) summarize five benchmarking lead elements with knowledge transfer,
supply chain, learning transfer, technology transfer, and information sharing.
   Tracogna (2013) benchmarks the Sweden furniture industry in the EU context with
sectorial level indicators such as production, number of enterprises, growth rates,
number of employment, apparent labor productivity, average ROE, average EBITDA,
and average ROA. The result shows that Sweden achieves the higher benchmarking
indicators than the other EU countries, especially in recent years. FIRA (2010)
calculates the key performance indicators (KPIs) of the UK furniture manufacturing
industry including value-added per turnover, fixed assets per value-added, stock
turnover, turnover per employee, value-added per employee, unit labor costs, labor cost
per value-added, return on capital employed, return on sales. These KPIs then are
benchmarked against other sectors such as manufacturing, food, fabricated metal
products, machinery, electrical, motor vehicles, and chemicals and the result confirms a
significant finding that the furniture industry has consciously implemented tactics to
reduce stock holding. Zairi (1994b) explains that benchmarking is determined by critical
factors to be more effective and lead to successful result. The factors include: (1) overall
                                             46




impact on customer satisfaction; (2) the extent of contribution to raising competitive
standards; (3) opportunity to create the learning organization; (4) inspirations from best-
in-class companies; (5) strengthening weaker processes; (6) enhancing knowledge pool;
(7) bringing in state-of-the-art practices; (8) keeping the organization externally
focused; and (9) extending employees' creative contributions. Szulanski and Winter
(2002), moreover, identify five barriers to effective benchmarking, as follows: (1)
uncooperative sources; (2) strained personal relationships; (3) internal competition; (4)
overemphasis on innovation; and (5) cranky copiers.
   Luu et al. (2008) employ benchmarking to evaluate and improve the construction
project management. These authors modify the conceptual research framework of
benchmarking with nine key performance indicators (KPIs) applied to measure PMP
and evaluate potential contractors as well as their capacity by requesting these indices.
The results suggest that benchmarking approach can help construction firms to learn
from the best practices of others and carry out continuous improvement. Tuan (2015)
identifies the challenges in applying the lean manufacturing management in SMEs by
comparing a company with Toyota based on nine indicators such as time, leader, staff,
learning culture, decision making, process standards, quality control, visual control, and
technology. Tuan suggests that the enterprise should consider lean management as a
long-term strategy and sacrifice some short-term benefit for changing company culture,
especially learning culture.
   In conclusion, this comprehensive literature review of competitiveness indicates that
the competitiveness is a relatively general, broad, and arguing concept and indicator.
There are several definitions of the competitiveness and various frameworks measuring
competitiveness with different economic implications, different components and
perspectives, different approaches, and at different levels. The scholars will identify,
modify, and employ the definition and the frameworks which are the most appropriate
and well satisfied the research objectives and scopes. In this thesis, the authors will first
                                           47




employ the trade performance indices to measure the agricultural competitiveness of
Vietnam as a cross-sections analysis and to investigate the agricultural trade pattern of
the ASEAN countries as a cross-countries analysis. Next, the economic indicators will
be used to analyze the competitiveness of the alternative crop sectors in Ben Tre
province, Vietnam. Finally, the integrated performances of these alternative crop sectors
will be assessed and discussed by various indicators. The consistency of the indictors in
the trade performance and the PAM approaches will be analyzed and compared.
Appendices of Agricultural Overviews of the ASEAN, Vietnam, and Ben Tre
   The reviews of the agricultural sectors in the ASEAN countries, Vietnam, and Ben
Tre province show that agricultural sectors are the key social and economic contributor
to the ASEAN countries, Vietnam, and Ben Tre. These regions, generally, have the
relative comparative advantages in the agricultural sectors from the natural climate and
environment, the fertile soil, and the abundant water resource to produce and export
agricultural products. The agricultural sectors, however, encounter various problems
such as the domination of small-scale farms, negative impact on the environment,
cultivation land conversion towards urbanization and industrialization, new challenges
from climate changes, increasing input costs, and low productivity.
Appendix 5: The ASEAN countries’ agricultural sectors
  The establishment of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) is in 2015 with
objectives of a single market, a competitive economic region, equitable economic
development, and integration into the global economy. Moreover, the ASEAN has
signed free trade agreements with dialogue partner countries such as Australia and New
Zealand, China, India, Japan, and Republic of Korea with different objectives, namely,
strengthening ASEAN’s trade and economic relationship with the partners, improving
the economic competitiveness of ASEAN countries as well as increasing the living
standard, enhancing economic integration of ASEAN countries, and creating of a more
enormous free market. The RCEP is proposed for a free trade agreement between these
partners with taking into account the EAFTA and the CEPEA. The AEC offers the
                                            48




opportunities in the form of a huge market of USD2.6 trillion and over 622 million
people in 2014. The ASEAN area is collectively the third largest economy in Asia and
the seventh largest economy in the world (ASEAN, 2017). Petri et al. (2012) believe
that the ASEAN economic integration could gain a similar result to those coming from
the European single market, amounting to 5.3 percent of the region’s income. The
benefits could be doubled if regional integration also leads to new free trade agreements
with key external partners and the whole region will share in these benefits.
   Although the ASEAN countries are diverse in terms of social, economic, and
political structures, they are in a similar geographical area and natural conditions (Siah
et al., 2009) and these may cause the countries to become competing to each other in
agricultural products on both the regional and global markets. Moreover, there are
significant   differences   of   agricultural    production   levels,   agricultural   trade
competitiveness, agricultural economic sizes, the development and globalization degree,
agricultural policies, and the perceptions of benefits among the ASEAN countries.
These differences may become the obstacles for the ASEAN members to the stronger
and closer economic integration and benefits from the activities.
   The agricultural sector significantly contributes to the economy and society of the
ASEAN countries. The agricultural sector is an important component of GDP in many
ASEAN countries such as Cambodia, Myanmar, Lao, Vietnam, and Indonesia with the
rates of 30.51 percent, 27.83 percent, 27.61 percent, 17.7 percent, and 13.34 percent
respectively. The sector also remarkably creates jobs and incomes for the people with
the high rate of employment in agricultural sectors of Lao, Cambodia, Vietnam,
Thailand, and Indonesia with the percent of 68.45, 51.94, 46.8, 41.9, and 51.94
respectively. The sectors account for the significant share of export value in Myanmar,
Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia with the rate of 26.5 percent, 25.0 percent,
17.5 percent, 17.1 percent, and 15.1 percent, respectively. Indonesia is the biggest
exporter of agricultural product with the value of USD 44,087 million, followed by
                                             49




Thailand and Malaysia with the value of USD 39,742 million and USD 30,130 million.
Singapore and Brunei are the least dependent on the agricultural sector while they
achieve the highest value-added per worker with the values of USD 107,077 and USD
120,880. Vietnam, Cambodia, and Lao are the most dependent on the agricultural sector
these countries, however, have the lowest value-added per worker with the values of
USD 791, USD 803, and USD 966, respectively (own calculation from World Bank and
World Trade Organization, 2017)
   The World Economic Forum calculates the agricultural policy cost as goods market
efficiency or competitiveness indicator in the Global Competitiveness Report. Singapore
and Malaysia achieve the high rankings of 3 and 8 with the point values of 5.3 and 5.
The rankings and values of these countries are relatively stable over time. Philippines,
Thailand, and Cambodia, however, have the low rankings of 109, 86, and 85 with the
point values of 3.2, 3.6, and 3.6. Philippines and Cambodia tend to lose their rankings.
   The agricultural technology and science levels are also important indicators and
relatively different among the ASEAN countries. Malaysia and Indonesia have the
largest expenditures on agricultural research with the expenditure values of USD 592.3
and USD 379.0 while Myanmar, Cambodia, and Lao PDR spend the least on
agricultural research. Thailand, Philippines, and Indonesia have the most agricultural
researchers and doctor agricultural researchers (SEARCA, 2015).
Appendix 6: Vietnamese agricultural sector
  OECD (2015), generally, reviews the Vietnam’s agricultural sector and national
economy as follows: (1) Vietnam is abundant in water but limited in arable land; (2) the
GDP is growing strongly; (3) the poverty rate is reducing; (4) the domestic food demand
is secured and the agricultural export increases; (5) the agricultural productivity growth
has decreased since 2000; (6) the value-added in export product is low; (7) the impact of
state enterprise is still strong; (8) the food safety control system is not effective enough;
(9) the farm size is small except for some big agricultural companies in the industrial
plant crops; (10) the limitation in land usage and land right; (11) the potential impact on
                                               50




natural environment reduces the agricultural productivity in long term; (12) the private
investment in agriculture grows with various limitations and obstacles such as the
limitation and un-warranty of land usage right, the barriers to rural and agricultural
credits, poor rural infrastructures, lacks of skillful and trained .
Appendix 6.1: Labor and employment in agricultural sector and rural area
   The agricultural sector and rural area account for the high rates of the labor and the
employment of Vietnam. In 1997, there are over 57 million people, equal to 77 percent
of population, living in the rural area. In 2016, the number increases with 61 million
people while the rate decreases with 65.8 percent. The employment in agricultural sector
accounts for a relatively high rate of total employment with 65.3 percent in 1997 and the
rate declines significantly in 2016 with 41.9 percent. In general, there is a higher percent
of female employments rather than male employments working in the agricultural sector
of Vietnam (World Bank, 2017).
   The data show that the agricultural sector and rural area still play important roles in
the economy and society of Vietnam in the modern and industrialized period. In other
words, the labor resource is relatively abundant for agricultural production. However,
the share of trained workers in total agricultural workers is very low in Vietnam in
general and in comparison with the average share of the country. In 2009, the share of
trained workers in total agricultural workers is 3.9 percent while the national average
share of trained workers is 14.8 percent. In 2015, the rate of agriculture grows slightly
and reaches 4.1 percent while the rate of the country is 20.6 percent. The percentages of
trained workers of agricultural workers and total country have increasing trend but the
increase of percentage of trained workers of total country is higher than those of
agricultural workers (GSO, 2017).
Appendix 6.2: Agricultural land and arable land
   In 1997, the agricultural land area is about 78,440 sq.km and accounts for 24.1
percent of the total land area of Vietnam. The agricultural land area stably increases
                                             51




over time and reaches the area of 108,737 km² in 2014, equal to 35.07 percent of the
total land area. The annual growth rate of agricultural land area is about 2 percent over
the period 1997-2014. The arable land percentage of total land area is relatively high
and slightly increases over time. In 1997, the arable land accounts for 17.41 percentage
of total land area, equal to 5,668,000 ha. In 2014, the arable land reaches 6,409,500 ha
and accounts for 20.67 percentage of total land area. The average growth of the arable
land area is about 1 percent annually. The arable land per person is relatively low in
Vietnam and it tends to decrease over time. The arable land per person is 0.076 ha per
person in 1997 and reaches the number of 0.071 ha/person in 2014. Vietnam’s indicator
of arable land per person is very low in comparison with other countries and it ranks
185th in the global list (World Bank, 2017).
   Moreover, Vietnam is located in both a tropical and a temperate zone and has a long
coastline of 3,260 km. The climate in the country differs significantly between the North
and the South. There are four clearly different seasons in the North and two seasons in
the South. These characteristics make Vietnam to have the various natural conditions for
agricultural production and several agricultural products. The country obtains a
considerable amount of sunny days and a high rate of rainfall and humidity with a large
number of rivers and canals. Vietnam, however, has been seriously impacted by climate
changes, especially the Mekong Delta area.
Appendix 6.3: Agricultural technology and science
   Vietnam has a long history and experience in agricultural production and the farmers
in the country are skillful and good at farming. Vietnam’ agricultural sector, in fact, has
the non-competitive technologies and undeveloped sciences despite of the government’s
large investment in agricultural technologies and sciences at universities, centers,
institutes and state agricultural enterprises. There are more than 10,800 scientists
working in the agriculture sector and the government spends over VND 1000 billion
annually on agricultural scientific research and technology transfer. The country has
                                           52




imported agricultural technologies such as post-harvesting, preserving, greenhouse, and
drip irrigation system from Israel, Japan, and Netherlands (Vietnamnet, 2014).
   Vietnam has the average rankings of agricultural science and technology indicators
in comparison with other ASEAN countries. The country’s agricultural science and
technology rankings, however, have increased over time. Vietnam has 2,261 agricultural
researchers in 2000 and 3,744 agricultural researchers in 2010. The average growth of
the total agricultural researchers is about 4 percent annually. The country spends about
USD 62 million on the agricultural science and technology research in 2000 and about
USD 136 million on the agricultural research in 2010. The average growth of the total
agricultural research spending is about 9 percent annually (Agricultural Science and
Technology Indicators, 2017). In general, Vietnam has low rankings in scientific
research with two indicators of the quality of scientific research institutions and the
availability of scientists and engineers in the global competitiveness reports. Moreover,
the scientific research ranking indicators of Vietnam tend to decrease over time (World
Economic Forum, 2017).
Appendix 6.4: Agricultural investments
   The investment in agriculture is relatively low and accounts for small share in total
investment of Vietnam. In 2016, the total investment of Vietnam is VND 1,485,096
billion and state investment is VND 557,496 billion. The total investment in agriculture
is VND 90,591 billion, equal to 6.1 percent. The state investment in agriculture is VND
34,119 billion, also equal to 6.1 percent. Moreover, the percentage of investment in
agriculture tends to decrease slightly over the period 2005-2016. In 2005, the
agricultural investment accounts for 7.5 percent in total investment and 7.1 percent in
state investment. The agricultural sector gets only 6.1 percent of both total and state
investment in 2016 (GSO, 2017).
   It is notable that the registered accumulation of foreign direct investment in
agriculture in 2016 is very small against the total registered accumulation of foreign
                                           53




direct investment. The registered accumulation of foreign direct investment in
agriculture is about USD 3,574 in 522 agricultural projects, equal to 1.2 percent only
(GSO, 2017). Per-project scale of foreign direct investment is relatively small in
agriculture, with USD 6.85 million per project investment on average. The top
agricultural foreign direct investment investors in Vietnam come from Taiwan,
Indonesia, and Thailand. Japan and South Korea are both making the best efforts to
encourage export-driven foreign direct investment into Vietnamese agriculture. A good
case study of foreign direct investment project in agriculture to Vietnam is AEON. The
company plans to seek Vietnamese providers for its outlets in Vietnam, Cambodia,
Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia. In 2014, AEON purchased USD 6.8 million of
Vietnamese agricultural products such as fruit and vegetables, seafood, and processed
foods (Corr and Nguyen, 2015).
Appendix 6.5: Agricultural production
   Though achieving comparative advantage from the natural environment, land and
human resources the agricultural sector of Vietnam has relatively low productivity and
small contribution to the world agricultural sector. In 2016, the agricultural value of
Vietnam reaches over USD 33 billion and accounts for 1.04 percent of the world
agricultural value-added only. The rate slightly grows over time. The agricultural sector
plays more important role in the economy of Vietnam rather than those of the world in
general. In detail, Vietnam’s agricultural sector accounts for 18.89 percent of Vietnam’s
GDP while the agricultural sector accounts for only 3.79 percent of the world GDP in
2015. The rate of Vietnam is about 5 times higher than the rate of the world. The share
of agricultural sector values in GDP declines more quickly than those of the world over
time. However, the agricultural value-added per worker of Vietnam is relatively low in
general and in comparison to the world. In 2016, Vietnam’s agricultural value-added per
worker is USD 813, equal to 40 percent against with the world value of USD 2,024. The
indicator of Vietnam grows faster than the world indicator (World Bank. 2017).
                                           54




   The gross output of product per ha of cultivated land is relatively higher than those
of aquaculture water surface in Vietnam. The values of both cultivated land and
aquaculture water surface significantly increase over the period 2004-2016. The gross
output of product per ha of cultivated land and aquaculture water surface are VND 42.5
million and VND 21.1 million in 2004, and VND 187.1 million and VND 84.5 million
in 2016 (GSO, 2017).
Appendix 6.6: Agricultural trade
   The agricultural export value significantly contributes to the total export value and
GDP in Vietnam. In 2016, the sector export value is USD 25,210 million, accounting for
14.28 percent of the national export, 12.2 percent of the Vietnam’s GDP, and 76.24
percent of the country’s agricultural GDP. The agricultural export value increases stably
whereas its share in the total export value and the national GDP decreases over time.
The shares of Vietnam’s agricultural export and import values in the world trade are
relatively small but modestly increase. Vietnam’s agricultural export and import values
account for 1.24 percent and 0.63 percent of the world trade in 2009, and reach 1.66
percent and 1.24 percent in 2015 (calculation from GSO and UN Comtrade, 2017). The
main agricultural export products of Vietnam are wood, spices, rice, rubber, coffee,
crustaceans, fish, vegetables, tea & mate, and fruits and the top 10 biggest agricultural
import markets of Vietnam are the USA, China, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong –
China, Germany, the UAE, Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Malaysia.
Appendix 6.7: Agricultural policy
   Since the Renovation in 1986, Vietnam’s agricultural policies have been changed
and improved significantly to enhance the agricultural production and export, reduce
poverty, and develop rural areas. The agricultural development in Vietnam is closely
related to the land policy evolution and reform which is the fundamental resource of
agricultural production and rural living. In Vietnam, however, land is owned by the state
and thus Vietnamese people cannot own and sell land. The land for agriculture and
                                            55




arability is very limited in Vietnam. The people have right to use, inherit, and rent out
the land. They are also permitted to use land for farming, with this right guaranteed. The
land policy may reduce people’s incentives or discourage people to contribute to and
invest in sustainable and high-tech agricultural production in the long term. Under the
Land Law in 1993 and 2003, Vietnam’s farmers have been allocated land for long term
usage with five rights granted, namely the rights of transfer, exchange, lease, inheritance
and mortgage while the land still belongs to the state. The new land policy gives
incentives people to invest in and increase the agricultural production at a higher level.
It, however, causes various conflicts and problems in social and economic activities.
Vietnam’s agricultural policy can be divided into five periods (OECD, 2015): (i)
reunifying the country from 1975-1986 with a highly centralized planned and socialist-
oriented economy; (ii) reforming and innovating economy from 1986-1993 with a
socialist-oriented market and open economy; (iii) expanding economy from 1993-2000
with focus on innovating the institution, attracting investments, and improving
technology; (iv) strengthening and reinforcing the agricultural economy from 2000-
2008 with focus on the modernization and industrialization of agriculture; and (v)
restructuring and re-orienting the agricultural economy with focus on enhancing
agricultural sustainable competitiveness, increasing agricultural value-added, and
improving the agricultural product quality with local and international standards.
   Vietnam’s agricultural policy can be structured and categorized as follows: (1)
agricultural price subsidy tools such as the national reserve programs, the food price
floors and ceilings policy, the price stabilization fund (PSF), the export promotion funds
(EPF), the food registered prices, and other local subsidy programs and policies; (2)
irrigation system fees: the farms are supported these costs by the government; (3)
supporting crop and livestock seeds for farmers, especially in cases of the new variety,
agricultural disease crisis, and for diversification; (4) the program 135 to help people in
ethnic minority and mountainous areas overcome poverty, narrow the income gap with
                                           56




other communes in other districts and provinces and eliminate risks for social
instability; (5) credit program for farmers with lower interest, easier guarantee
conditions, and more simple process; (6) direct subsidy for paddy rice production; (7) a
pilot program of agricultural insurance in 21 provinces for rice, livestock, and fishery;
(8) the land usage exemption ad reduction for farmers since 2003; (9) farming
promotion service; (10) agricultural research, training, and development; (11) rural
infrastructure, irrigation system, storage systems, climate change programs, and others
agricultural policies and programs.
Appendix 6.8: Global economic and trade integration of Vietnam
   In recent decades, Vietnam has opened its economy strongly and integrated deeply
in the global economy and market. The country has been a member of the ASEAN area
with the key milestone of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) and signed various
strategic free trade agreements such as ASEAN-India, ASEAN-Australia/New Zealand,
ASEAN-Korea, ASEAN-Japan, ASEAN-China, TPP-CPTPP, Vietnam-Japan, Vietnam-
Chile, Vietnam-Korea, Vietnam-Eurasian Economic Union, and Vietnam-EU. The free
trade agreements of the ASEAN and Partner countries are signed to with the aim of
establishing an ASEAN – Partners free trade areas. The ASEAN and six Partner
countries are also negotiating to establish the Regional Comprehensive Economic
Partnership (RCEP). Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP-CPTPP) is a free trade agreement
among twelve country members, including United States, Canada, Mexico, Peru, Chile,
New Zealand, Australia, Japan, Singapore, Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam. TPP-CPTPP
is officially signed on February 4th, 2016 and it is expected to come into force in 2018.
The agreement between Vietnam and Japan for an economic partnership is signed on
December 25th, 2008. This is the very first bilateral FTA of Vietnam, in which both
Vietnam and Japan give the other more preferences than that agreed under the
agreement for comprehensive economic partnership ASEAN – Japan. The free trade
agreement between Chile and Vietnam is signed on November 11th, 2011. This FTA
                                           57




includes only commitments on goods and goods-related matters without the
commitments on services and investment. The free trade agreement between Vietnam
and Korea is signed on May 5th, 2015. The VKFTA contains more preferences that the
partners give to each other in the field of goods, services and investment in comparison
to the FTA of ASEAN-Korea. On May 29, 2015, Vietnam and the Eurasian Economic
Union members including Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan,
officially sign the Vietnam - Eurasian Economic Union free trade agreement in
Kazakhstan. Vietnam and the European Union sign the free trade agreement on 02
December, 2015 after three years of negotiations. The agreement will remove nearly all
tariffs on goods traded between the Vietnam and the EU economy including 28 member
countries. This is the largest and deepest free trade agreement of Vietnam. Moreover,
the country is going to expand its export markets by the free trade agreements of RCEP,
Vietnam-Israel, Vietnam-EFTA, and ASEAN-Hong Kong (WTO Center, 2017).
Appendix 7: The Agriculture in Ben Tre Province
  Ben Tre is an agricultural province located in the Mekong Delta, 85 km south of Ho
Chi Minh City, 124 km north of Can Tho City with the natural area of 2,360 sp. km. The
province is next to Tien Giang Province to the north, Vinh Long to the west, and Tra
Vinh to the south. Ben Tre is situated between two main branches of the Mekong river,
created by and divided into three islands An Hoa, Bao and Minh by the Tien and the Ba
Lai rivers with 83 km and 59 km long in the north, the Co Chien river with 82 km long
in the south, and the Ham Luong river with 71 km long straight down the center of the
province. Ben Tre is near by sea with about 65 km coastline and surrounded by a
network of smaller rivers and canals with about 6.000 km long.
   Ben Tre achieves a relatively high economic, social, and infrastructure growth
recently. In 2016, the province’s GDP growth is 5.3 percent, slightly higher than those
of 2015 with 5.1 percent and lower than those of the plan with 6.5 percent. The
agricultural sector only grows 0.9 percent while industrial and service sectors obtain
10.8 percent and 7.1 percent. The main reason of agricultural low growth is the impact
                                            58




of climate change and Mekong river alluvium shortage. In 2016, the province has the
total GDP of VND 27,077 billion, the agricultural GDP of VND 14,305 billion
accounting for 38.6 percent, the industrial GDP of VND 6,268 billion accounting for
16.9 percent, and the service GDP of VND 15,078 billion accounting for 40.7 percent.
Ben Tre achieves the GDP per capita of VND 29.3 million per year, equal to USD
1,331.8 in 2016. The export value of Ben Tre in 2016 is about USD 726.3 million with
the trade surplus of USD 520 million, growing 11.4 percent against 2015. Its main
export products are aquatic and fishery products, rice, coconut fiber, coconut copra,
other coconut processing products, fruits, and garment and clothing (HDND Ben Tre,
2016). Ben Tre, moreover, obtains the high rankings of province competitiveness index
(PCI) over time. The province has the PCI ranking of 12 in 2016 with the PCI of 60.91,
unchanged in comparison with those of 2015. Ben Tre’s rankings tend to increase while
its PCI values tend to decrease over time (pcivietnam.org, 2017). In average, Ben Tre
obtains the highest degrees in Entry Costs, Informal Charges, Land Access, and time
cost with the values of 8.30, 7.39, 7.18, and 7.01 respectively.
   In general, Ben Tre has the relative comparative advantages to produce, export, and
develop various agricultural sectors based on the natural, social, and economic
conditions. The main agricultural economic activities of Ben Tre are sea and river
fishery (fish, shrimp, and crustaceans), coconut, fruits, rice, sugar cane, livestock, and
poultry. Coconut, Da Xanh pomelo fruit, and rice can be considered as the typical crops
of the province. Coconut is the symbol of Ben Tre province and it establishes a strong
and potential processing sector significantly contributes to the economy and export
value. Ben Tre is also famous for Da Xanh pomelo fruit with delicious quality and good
appearance. Da Xanh pomelo generates very high incomes for farmers and relatively
contributes to Ben Tre’s economy and society. Rice is not a highly profitable product
but it is the traditional and stable crop in Ben Tre province. The sector, moreover,
ensures the food security for the local, national and export demands.
                                            59




   In 2016, Ben Tre has the coconut area of 69.330 ha, an increase of 785 ha in
comparison to 2015 and the production of 587.9 million fruit units, an increase of 2.6
percent of those in 2015 (Ben Tre, 2016). There are about over 1,970 processing
coconut enterprises and households with different products, technologies, sizes, and
markets in Ben Tre. The total coconut production value is over VND 2,850 billion, an
increase of 3.5 percent in comparison to 2015. The sector’s export value reaches USD
150.47 million, accounting for over 20.72 percent of the total export of Ben Tre.
Coconut brings in the average income of over VND 50 million/ha/year for farmers,
VND 115 million/household/year for middle collectors, and relatively high incomes and
profits for other actors in the sectors such as primary processors, production companies,
and traders and exporters (Tran et al., 2011).
   Fruit is an important sector in Ben Tre with over 27,742 ha and 302,443 ton in 2016.
The main and typical fruits of Ben Tre are Da Xanh pomelo, durian, orange,
mangosteen, rambutan, and longan. Da Xanh pomelo is the most typical and profitable
fruit in Ben Tre province. In 2015, Ben Tre’s Da Xanh pomelo has the area of 6,205 ha,
the production of 50,762 ton, and the turnover of VND 3,3 billion. The area and
production of Da Xanh pomelo in Ben Tre and Vietnam are estimated to increase
quickly in the future. Da Xanh pomelo creates the high income for farmers with over
VND 356 million/ha/year (Hoang et al., 2017). In 2016, Ben Tre has 58,246 ha of rice
crop, a decrease 7.5 percent in comparison with 2015. Rice production is 164,269 ton,
strong decrease against those of 2015 with 278,769 ton. The main reason for the decline
is the impact of the climate change, soil salinity, and drought. Ben Tre is promoting
large-scale rice farm programs and models to enhance productivity, improve quality,
reduce input cost, and apply high production standards such as VietGAP, Organic, and
GlobalGAP. The province has obtained over 1,122 ha of the rice model with the
productivity of 5.5 ton/ha and certified as VietGAP label (HDND Ben Tre, 2016).
