                                     Abstract
   The transmission of monetary policy is the center of economic studies, this field was
renewed in light of the 2008 global financial crisis with arguments about the
effectiveness and the determinants of transmission channels especially in emerging
markets such as Vietnam which may have strong bank lending channel while asset price
channel and exchange rate channel may be weak.

   This study tries to investigate the existing of interest rate channel, exchange rate
channel, asset price channel, and bank lending channel in Vietnam which are seen as
the main channels in monetary policy transmission. In addition, this study tries to
investigate the determinants of bank lending channel and the effects of the 2008 global
financial crisis on bank lending channel in Vietnam that are important for Vietnamese
policy makers in conducting monetary policy, stabilizing banking systems, financial
markets and the economy.

   Firstly, this study utilizes the VAR model to examine the existing of interest rate
channel, asset price channel and exchange rate channel, one by one, by using monthly
macroeconomics data from 2003 to 2012 including market interest rates, the stock
market index and exchange rate to proxy for interest rate channel, asset price channel
and exchange rate channel respectively. Then this study uses SVAR models to test the
existing of these channels in a system with the same data sample. Secondly, this study
collects yearly data from 30 Vietnamese commercial banks such as loans, assets, loan
loss provision, capital from 2003 to 2012 to investigate the existing and the
determinants of bank lending channel through the system GMM models. Then, this
study uses the S&P 500 implied volatility index to investigate the effects of the 2008
global financial crisis on bank lending channel through the same system GMM models.

   With the first main objective, this study has found the evidence of cost channel in
Vietnam that reflects the ineffective of monetary policy in controlling inflation thus it
is a big challenge for Vietnamese policy makers in conducting monetary policy. But,
this study did not find statistical evidences of exchange rate channel and asset price
channel which may be suggest that they are weak or do not exist in Vietnam.

   In the second main objective, this study found the evidences of bank lending channel
in Vietnam, it was also affected by the commercial bank characteristics such as bank
capital, bank size. This study also found that the 2008 global financial crisis had
significant effects on bank lending channels which is stronger in crisis.

   First of all, this study has contribution to the empirical literature about the existence
of cost channel in a small open economy. Secondly, this study contributes empirical
evidences of bank lending channel, the determinants and the effects of the crisis on bank
lending channel in an emerging market. Thirdly, this study has major contributions to
Vietnamese policy makers in conducting monetary policy and stabilizing the banking
system and financial markets, especially in the case of facing further external shocks in
the future such as the global crisis. With the academic contributions, this study defined
that economists should test all transmission channels in one model for better controlling
the interactions between channels and better measuring the effectiveness of each
channel.

   With the empirical results, this study has significant practical implications for
Vietnamese policy makers in developing debt and equity markets, controlling the risky
activities of banking systems and applying unconventional monetary policies such as
inflation targeting.

1.1.       The overview of Vietnamese economy and monetary policy
           1.1.1. The Vietnamese economy

   The ‘Doi Moi” policy since 1980s has been transmitted to the Vietnamese economy
from plan to market-oriented economy, but it is still limited to phrase "market economy
under the management of the state". The changes in economy led to many changes in
the economic structure and even in the law system with the birth of the 1992 constitution
that had acknowledged private sectors (see table 1.1 in Appendix 1 for more information
about law system innovations). The Vietnamese economy has gone through high growth
periods from 1994, in which it has had two slow periods due to the 1997 Asian economic
crisis and the 2008 global financial crisis (see figure 1.1 and 1.2 in appendix 1). To cope
with crisis and slowdown in the economy, Vietnamese government implemented a
stimulus packages worth 143,000 billion VND (equivalent to USD 8 billion at 2009
exchange rate) in 2009, then increased to 160,000 billion VND later (equivalent to USD
9 billion), it has recovered GDP growth to 6.8% in 2010, but their effects did not last
long, Vietnam fell into instability again in in 2011 and 2012.

   In the trend of international integration, Vietnam has integrated stronger and deeper
into the world economy by signing the Vietnam – U.S. trade agreement in 2001 and
officially joined WTO on 11/Jan/2007, thus trade activities have increased from 10
billion USD in 1994 to over 80 billion USD in 2006, and over 200 billion USD in 2012
(see figure 1.3 in Appendix 1), which makes the Vietnamese economy more vulnerable
to the international shocks which became clearer in the 2008 global financial crisis when
the Vietnamese economy fell into a difficult situation: bad debt in the banking system,
inventory rising, recession in the real estate market and securities market, especially the
real estate market which severely degraded in 2011 and 2012.

       1.1.2. The State Bank of Vietnam

   Roles, duties, and functions of the State bank of Vietnam (SBV) was separated by
the 1990 banking ordinance, it was defined as an agency of the council of ministers
(now is government) with the functions of managing monetary policy, credit, and
banking system in order to stabilize currency values, and the role of the exclusive money
printing department of Socialist Republic of Vietnam. However, the 1990 banking
ordinance didn’t clearly indicate the independence of SBV in monetary policy
conducting under the government management (see table 2.1 in Appendix 2). According
to the 1990 banking ordinance, SBV could use rediscount rate (article 43), reserve
requirement (article 44), minimum deposit interest rates and maximum lending interest
rates (article 43), clearing organization (article 45), but it didn’t directly mention how
SBV could manage the money supply and policy rates. Then, the 1997 state bank act
specified that SBV was a government agency with functions of monetary management,
banking system management, and money issuing. SBV aimed to stabilize currency
value, ensure safety of banking system and credit institutions, and promote economic
development (clause 1, 2, 3 of article 1). Article 2 of the 1997 state bank act also stated
that SBV was the monetary policy conductor, SBV could use: refinance rates, reserve
requirements, interbank payments, and credit supply management to conduct monetary
policy. Until 2003, the 2003 state bank act amendment was launched to amend some
articles of the 1997 version that provided more specific details on rediscount rates,
                                            3


refinance rates, open market operations, base rates, and banking operations, but the roles
and functions of SBV did not change.

   The operations of SBV were more apparent in the 2007 – 2012 period when the
Vietnamese economy fell into crisis. In 2010, the Vietnamese parliament approved the
2010 state bank act with changes in comparison to the 2003 version, in which the most
important change was the SBV’s function of monetary policy conducting in article 2.
However, the 2010 state bank act still defined that SBV was a government agency; it
remains under government control in monetary policy conducting. The annual target of
inflation is still defined by Vietnamese parliament thus there is no progression in the
independence of SBV. However, there is an important step in determining the main
target of monetary policy, the 2010 state bank act defines that price stability is sole
target of monetary policy that doesn’t include the target of economic growth. Article 10
of the 2010 state bank act defines monetary policy tools as refinance rates, rediscount
rates, foreign exchange rates, reserve requirements, open market operations, and other
tools that are permitted by government.

       1.1.3. The Vietnamese monetary policy

   SBV had expanded the monetary policy in the 2000 – 2007 period to cope with the
1997 Asian crisis and to stimulate economic growth, then they expanded and tightened
monetary policy on numerous occasions in the 2008 – 2012 period. After the 1997
Asia crisis, Vietnam expanded monetary policy to stimulate investment and
consumption to cope with crisis, thus M2 grew up to 39.2% in 1999 and 56.2% in 2000
(see figure 2.2 in Appendix 2). After joining the WTO in 2007, high economic growth
combined with large capital inflows made M2 raise up to 46.1% in 2007, and it was still
high in the 2008 – 2012 period (see figure 2.2 in Appendix 2). Money supply from under
50,000 billion VND in 1994 had increased to over 200,000 billion VND in 2000, nearly
1 million billion VND in 2006, and over 3.6 million billion VND in 2012 (see figure
2.1 in Appendix 2). Besides that, SBV constantly couldn’t keep targets of monetary
policy. From 2004 to 2006, targets of M2 growth rate were 22%, 22%, and 23-25% per
year respectively, but SBV always broke them in implementation, M2 growth rates were
                                               4


actually higher than targets from 7% to 10% per year, this situation continued in 2007,
2009, 2010 and 2012 and then after (see table 2.2 in Appendix 2).

   Vietnam interbank offer rate (VNIBOR) decreased in 1999, 2000 and then stabilized
at 6% to 7% per year in 2001 – 2007 period alongside money supply growth (see figure
2.3 in Appendix 2). SBV kept a low interest rate to cope with the 1997 Asian crisis and
kept it for a long time to simulate economic growth in the latter period. In the next
period, VNIBOR fluctuated: increasing sharply in 2008, decreasing in 2009, increasing
again in 2010 and 2011, and then decreasing in 2012. The changes in VNIBOR reflected
unstability in monetary policy, SBV tightened monetary policy to control inflation in
2008, expanded to stimulus economic growth in 2009, tightened again to control
inflation in 2010 and 2011, and then expanded to stimulate the economy in 2012 and
continuing (see figure 2.3 in Appendix 2). It is easy to realize that SBV has lost their
proactive approach in monetary policy conducting (see figure 2.4 in Appendix 2). The
changes in money supply and policy rates all confirmed that SBV had expanded
monetary policy in 2000 – 2007 period, tightened in 2008, expanded in 2009, 2010,
tightened in 2011, and expanded again in 2012 and the following years (see figure 2.4
in Appendix 2). These changes led to several changes in Vietnam’s macroeconomic
factors.

       1.1.4. The Vietnamese monetary policy and macroeconomics factors
              1.1.4.1. Market interest rates

   Market deposit rates and lending rates had changed in the same patterns with
VNIBOR. Average deposit rates fell sharply from 9.23% in 1998 to 3.65% in 2000,
meanwhile lending rates fell less and slower then they were stable at a low level in the
2000 – 2007 period (see figure 2.5 in Appendix 2), but they fluctuated with the changes
in monetary policy by increasing in 2008, decreasing in 2009, increasing in 2010, 2011,
and dropping in 2012.

              1.1.4.2. Inflation

   Prior to 2000, inflation was low and it even fell sharply to -1.6% in 2000, low
inflation along with low economic growth motivated SBV to expand monetary policy
                                           5


in the period after 2000, but the expansionary monetary policy in the long term created
inflation risk. The overheating economic growth, large and inefficient public
investment, a sharp increase of aggregate demand after joining WTO, long lasting
budget deficit, high credit growth, and high money supply growth in combination with
the increase in the world commodity price, and other things had pushed Vietnamese
inflation to a high rate in 2008 – 2012 period. Inflation rose sharply from 8.33% in 2007
up to 23.08% in 2008, which created a major shock to the Vietnamese economy. SBV
tightened monetary policy immediately in 2008 by raising policy rates, reducing money
supply, while Vietnamese government tightened fiscal policy, cut spending to cope with
inflation which fell sharply from 23.08% in 2008 to 5.93% in 2009 in just one year (see
figure 2.6 in Appendix 2). Both contractionary monetary policy and contractionary fiscal
policy helped control inflation, but this sudden change in inflation was not completely
good for the economy because GDP growth fell to 5.3% in 2009, the lowest rate in
comparison with the previous period (see figure 1.2 in Appendix 1).

   The spreading of the 2008 global financial crisis put Vietnam in danger of recession
so the government implemented a stimulus package, while SBV implemented
expansionary monetary policy in 2009 to stimulate economy. GDP growth recovered to
6.8% in 2010, but expansionary monetary policy and expansionary fiscal policy once
again caused inflation in 2010 and 2011 (see figure 2.6 in Appendix 2). With the
experience of 2008, Vietnamese government immediately issued Resolution no.11 that
tightened fiscal and monetary policy to cope with inflation. This policy helped inflation
decrease, but it couldn’t completely control inflation, Vietnam’s inflation rose to over
18% in 2011 (see figure 2.6 in Appendix 2). As stated, one of the problems of SBV in
conducting monetary policy was policy disciplines, which was reflected more clearly
through inflation targets. SBV usually didn’t achieve inflation targets, for example it
was set less than 5% but the actual figure was 7.7% in 2004, the same situation
happened in 2005, 2008, 2010 and 2011 (see table 2.3 in Appendix 2).
                                           6


              1.1.4.3. Exchange rate

    The USD/VND rate increased from 10,966 in 1994 to 15,994 in 2006 and 20,293 in
2012 (see figure 2.8 in Appendix 2). Vietnamese currency remained stable in 1994 and
1995, but the outflow of foreign capital plus the decrease in export put pressures on
exchange rates throughout the 1997 Asia crisis. USD/VND increased with a low stable
step after 2000, until 2007 it was at 16,105. In fact, the increase in money supply, low
interest rates, more open economy as well as trade deficit led to depreciation of VND.
After 2007, the USD/VND continued to rise in 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011, and stilled
in 2012 (see figure 2.8 in Appendix 2) due to the dual deficits in trade balance and
balance of payments in 2009 and 2010 in combination with the 2008’s global financial
crisis, the trend of capital withdrawal out of Vietnam, the low remittances in 2009, thus
SBV declared currency devaluation on numerous occasions throughout the 2008 – 2012
period 1. In addition, high inflation in 2008 has lost people’s faith in VND so people
turned to hold USD rather than VND despite the high interest rate of VND’s deposits.

              1.1.4.4. Credit

    Credit was expanded quickly and broadly in 2000 – 2007 period from 50,000 billion
VND in 1994 to over 700,000 billion VND in 2006 and over 3,200,000 billion VND
in 2012, it particularly increased to 70% in 2000 and 50% in 2007 (see figure 2.10 in
Appendix 2). The expansionary monetary policy with increasing money supply,
decreasing policy rates that decreased lending rates of commercial banks thus
simulating private sectors to borrow for investment and consumption. The high credit
growth was also a result of the 1997 state bank act and the 1997 credit institutions act
that created a legal background for commercial banks and other financial institutions.
In addition, the high economic growth rate required large capital input, but Vietnamese
stock market had just launched in 2000, and it was too small to meet the capital needs
of the economy. Credit had fluctuated strong in the 2008 – 2012 period but it grew
higher and rose from over 1 trillion VND in 2007 to over 3 trillion VND in 2012, but

1
 One of the most depth devaluation was on 11/2/2011, SBV devalued VND up to
9.3%.
                                             7


credit growth rates usually exceeded the targets of SBV such as in 2004, 2005, 2006,
2007, 2009, and 2010 (see table 2.4 in Appendix 2), these over-controlled growth caused
overheating growth and bad debt risks for the Vietnamese banking system and
economy. However, credit growth rate was much lower than the target of SBV in 2012
which shows that Vietnam economy had fallen into low-growth stage with low needs
of capital. Looking at the credit growth pattern, we find that it is quite contrary to policy
rates and market rates patterns, when policy and market rates raised, credit growth
decreased and vice versa.

              1.1.4.5. Stock markets

   Vietnam developed stock markets in the early 21st century with Ho Chi Minh stock
exchange in 2000 (HSX) then Hanoi stock exchange in 2006 (HNX). There were only
5 listed companies on HSX in 2000, then companies from various industries were listed,
but it remained insignificant in comparing to total enterprises. Besides that, almost all
listed companies are large with good financial health, meanwhile Vietnamese
companies are mainly small and medium. VNindex (the market composite index of
HSX) had two strong growth phases in 2001 and 2005 – 2007 period, while it was stable
in all remaining years in 2000 – 2007 period, these fluctuations were primarily caused
by the investor’s psychology and the foreign portfolio investment. Vietnamese
economy grew higher and was more stable in the 2000 – 2007 period, but VNindex
increased stronger in 2005 – 2007 period when foreign investment went in and the herd
behavior of domestic investors (see figure 2.12 in Appendix 2). Meanwhile, VNindex
changed very little even when economy, credit, investment, money supply grew and
interest rates were low in the 2002 – 2004 period. This shows that money supply during
2002 – 2004 period didn’t go into stock markets, it mainly went into manufacturing or
other channels, possibly real estate. But at the end of 2005 and 2006, a large amount of
money went into stock markets that made the VNindex and the HNXindex increase
sharply (see figure 2.12 and 2.13 in Appendix 2). Thus, stock markets may not have
responded strictly to monetary policy in the 2000 – 2006 period. After booming in 2007,
Vietnam’s stock market declined rapidly in 2008 and hit rock bottom in early 2009
when inflation was high and the 2008 global financial crisis impacted around the world.
                                                       8


A large amount of money was injected into the economy through economic stimulus
policies in 2009, while lower interest rates helped the Vietnamese stock markets to
make a slight recovery in 2009, then it continued to lower until 2012 after the stimulus
policies ended.



      1.2.     Research gap identification

      The analysis of macroeconomic, monetary policy and macroeconomic factors has
shown that Vietnamese economy grew rapidly in the 2000 – 2007 periods. The rapid
economic growth was seemly contributed from expansionary monetary policy, bank
credit operations with low inflation and low interest rates, and other elements. Monetary
policy was expanded with low policy rates, high money supply growth in the 2000 –
2007 period, but it reversed and change many times in the 2008 – 2012 period.
However, the overheating economic growth, credit growth, and money supply growth
had caused the Vietnamese economy to many more problems in 2008 – 2012 period.
The patterns of macroeconomic data suggest that the effects of the Vietnamese
monetary policy on economy may have been transmitted through market interest rates
and bank credit during the 2000 – 2012 periods, meanwhile it may not have been
transmitted through stock markets and exchange rates.

      Meanwhile, the theory states that the monetary policy impacts on the economy
through various transmission channels including interest rate channel, exchange rate
channel, asset price channel, credit channel and expectation channel, and bank lending
channel is an important sub-channel of credit channel in developing countries such as
Vietnam (Angeloni, Kashyap, Mojon, & Terlizzese, 2002; Apergis & Christou, 2015;
Bassett, Chosak, Driscoll, & Zakrajšek, 2014). Theoretical and experimental studies
confirm that monetary policy transmits through some main channels: interest rate
channel, exchange rate channel, asset price channel, credit channels 2 and expectation
channel (Mengesha & Holmes, 2013). However, in developed countries, interest rate


2
    Credit channel includes bank lending channel and other sub-channels
                                            9


channel is the most important transmission channel, while bank lending channel is the
enhanced channel for interest rate channel through commercial bank credit supply
(Altunbas, Fazylov, & Molyneux, 2002; Altunbas, Gambacorta, & Marques-Ibanez,
2009, 2012). In emerging countries, bank lending channel is an important channel
(Mishra & Montiel, 2012), which are affected by macroeconomic factors, industry
factors, and bank characteristics (Altunbas et al., 2002; Altunbas et al., 2009, 2012). If
the central bank tightens monetary policy, credit supply of commercial banks plummet
and more in small commercial banks, particularly the ones whose funds mainly come
from deposits (Kashyap & Stein, 2000; Stein, 1998). Monetary policy also impacts more
strongly on commercial banks that have small enterprises (Peek & Rosengren,
1995a,1995c; Van den Heuvel, 2002b).

   In fact, Vietnam is a small open emerging economy which has transmitted to the
market economy since the 1980’s. Vietnam now may share common characteristics of
small open emerging countries that have an incomplete institutional framework with a
young equity market, and an emerging financial market so that interest rate channel
might not be the most important channel. While, exchange rate channel might be weak
due to the intervention of government in foreign exchange markets and financial
markets. Furthermore, asset price channel might also be weak due to the low-
development stock markets. In contrast, Vietnam has the right potential conditions for
the existence of bank lending channel, which may become an important channel such
as Vietnamese economy depends strongly on commercial banks in capital supply;
private sectors (including enterprises, households, and individuals) rely heavily on bank
loans for investment, consumption and other economic activities; while Vietnamese
commercial banks rely heavily on deposits to supply loans, and they almost can’t
replace this source easily.

   There are many potential determinants of bank lending channels including
macroeconomics and microeconomics elements, in which bank capital, bank scale,
bank liquidity and bank risk are important characteristics which must be noticed and
studied (Altunbas et al., 2002; Altunbas et al., 2012). Meanwhile, the 2008 global
                                           10


financial crisis has strongly affected on Vietnamese economy so that monetary policy
transmission and bank lending channel may be affected and changed.

   From both academic aspects and empirical aspects, we need a comprehensive study
about monetary policy transmission in an emerging market such as Vietnam that are
motivations for this study in Vietnam. The next section presents objectives of this study.



1.3.   Research objectives and questions

   So, the research topic on monetary policy transmission and especial bank lending
channel are mentioned as the essential topic in studying monetary policy, especially in
emerging markets such as Vietnam.

   Firstly, this study attempts to test the existence of interest rate channel, exchange
rate channel, and asset price channel in Vietnam, these results are significant
considerations for Vietnamese policy makers in conducting the monetary policy. This
first objective aims at finding the existences of monetary policy channels and also
defines which important channel in Vietnam. This first study also is done as the
background for next objective of this study in finding the bank lending channel in
Vietnam. Since the bank lending channel is a sub-channel in credit channel, meanwhile
the other channels such as interest rate channel, exchange rate channel, and asset price
channel are seen as the main channels in monetary policy transmission, but credit
channel is also found strong in developing countries with low – development of
financial markets and high intervention of government into foreign exchange market
such as Vietnam. So, this study firstly tests the existence of interest rate channel,
exchange rate channel and asset price channel to make sure the sense of credit channel
existence in Vietnam and then go to the second part of this study.

   Secondly, this study attempts to investigate the existence of bank lending channels
and then analyze the determinants of bank lending channel including the effects of the
2008 global financial crisis which are also good for Vietnamese policy makers in
conducting monetary policy but also in stabilizing banking system and financial
                                            11


markets. Finally, this study attempts to discover some policy implications for
Vietnamese policy markets in conducting monetary policy, especially in facing shocks
such as the global crisis in the future. In order to achieve these research objectives, this
study goes to answer these questions

   1. Which do channels of interest rate channel, exchange rate channel and asset price
       channel exist in Vietnam?
   2. Does bank lending channel exist in Vietnam? And do bank size, bank capital,
       bank liquidity, bank risk, and the 2008 global financial crisis effect on bank
       lending channels in Vietnam?

       The scope of study is very important which may affect to the reliable of the study,
so next section presents this scope.



1.4.   The scope of this study

       This study is going to examine the monetary policy transmission and bank
lending channel in Vietnam in period from 2003 to 2012.

       Firstly, Vietnam as a developing and emerging economy that is also an open
small economy which is suitable for studying monetary policy transmission and bank
lending channel as stated in the purpose of this study. Secondly, in order to satisfy the
requirements of statistical models we need an appropriate period of time that why this
study is going to study in the period from 2003 to 2012 which is enough time to study
monetary policy transmission. This period is also suitable to test the impacts of the 2008
global financial crisis on the monetary policy transmission with the point on 2008.
Thirdly, this study is going to examine the existences of interest rate channel, exchange
rate channel and asset price channel which are seen as the main channels of monetary
policy transmission in both developed and developing countries. Meanwhile, due to
lack of data about expectations thus this study is not going to examine the expectation
channel. In addition, the credit channel will be tested through the bank lending channel.
Fourthly, this study is going to test the existence of bank lending channel through the
                                           12


micro-data of bank characteristics in Vietnam which will present for supply – side of
credit channel. Meanwhile, the other determinants such as macroeconomic conditions
are not examined because these factors present for the demand – side of credit channel
which are the factors in balance sheet channel. In order to find the right answers for
study’s questions, we need appropriate methodologies which will be clarified in next
section.



1.5.   Research methodologies and data
       1.5.1. Methodologies

   Many previous studies have used the VAR model (vector autoregression model) to
study the monetary policy transmission (Bernanke & Blinder, 1992; Walsh, 2010),
however the VAR model still has some drawbacks such as VAR depends on volume of
data, or economic theory which sometimes can not work even when the conditions of
VAR model are derived from this theory. Therefore, researchers suggest using SVAR
(structural vector autoregression model) which is developed from VAR for better
measurement of monetary policy transmission. SVAR requires fewer conditions than
the standard VAR model, but it still provides two tools to analyze monetary policy
transmission including impulse response functions and variance decomposition, while
the SVAR model is proposed to be used for small open economies because SVAR helps
detect and measure shocks better (S. Kim & Roubini, 2000). Meanwhile, the system
GMM model is considered as most appropriate to measure panel data due to the
advantages of this model in solving endogeneity, heteroskedasticity, autoregression
problems of dynamic panel data in comparison with other models such as pooled least
square, fixed effects model or random effects model (Arellano & Bond, 1991a; Arellano
& Bover, 1995b; Blundell & Bond, 1998, 2000; S. Bond & Meghir, 1994; S. R. Bond,
Hoeffler, & Temple, 2001).

   Thus in the first main body, this study is going to use the VAR models to investigate
the existence of interest rate channel, exchange rate channel, and asset price channel in
Vietnam through a monthly time series from 2003 to 2012 one by one. Then this study
                                           13


is going to use the SVAR model as the main model to check the test the evidences of
above channels. These results will answer for the 1st question. In the second main body,
this study uses the system GMM model to investigate bank lending channel in Vietnam,
in which this study also measures the impacts of bank characteristics and the 2008
global financial crisis on bank lending channel by yearly panel data in 2003 – 2012
period. The data of commercial bank characteristics such as size, capital, liquidity and
risk are incorporated into GMM model to investigate the determinants of bank lending
channels. Then, this study use S&P 500 implied volatility index to investigate the effect
of the 2008 global financial crisis on bank lending channel. These results will be
answered the 2nd question.

       1.5.2. Research data

   This study will use two kinds of data: Vietnamese macroeconomic data and
microeconomic data from commercial banks in the 2003-2012 period. Monthly
macroeconomic data including exchange rate, VNIndex, policy interest rates, market
interest rates (lending and deposit interest rates), money supply, and GDP growth from
2003 to 2012 that were collected from SBV, General Statistics Office of Vietnam and
IMF; while other international variables such as U.S. interest rates, U.S. GDP, oil prices
and other international data are collected from IMF. Yearly microeconomic data
including total asset, liquidity asset, capital, liquidity and loan loss provision are
collected from audited financial statements and annual reports of Vietnamese
commercial banks in 2003 – 2012 period. In order to be easier in understanding this
study, the next section presents some key concepts which are related to monetary policy,
monetary policy transmission and bank lending channel.



1.6.   Some key concepts

Monetary policy. In general, monetary policy is the macroeconomic policy that is
executed by a central bank in order to influence money supply and/or interest rate with
the ultimate target is inflation stability (Begg, Fischer, & Dornbusch, 2008).
                                           14


Central bank. Central bank is the monopoly agency in money issuance; it is also the
government's bank, the bank of the banks, the lender of last resort, the payment system
manager, and the banking system supervisor (Castiglionesi, 2007; Smart, 1999;
Summers, 1991). Yet, the most important role in a central bank is the monetary policy
manager (Goodhart, 1988).

Monetary policy targets. Monetary policy targets are often expressed in several
aspects such as maintaining economic stability, ensuring optimal unemployment, or
stabilizing the financial system, etc. (Richard Clarida, Gali, & Gertler, 1998; Rogoff,
1985). Yet in reality, a central bank cannot achieve all targets at one time so they have
to choose the most important targets in monetary policy conducting, this is price
stability (Cecchetti & Krause, 2002).

Monetary policy tools. To achieve monetary policy targets, central bank uses different
tools including three important tools: open market operations, policy interest rates, and
reserve requirements (Bean, Paustian, Penalver, & Taylor, 2010; Hamilton & Wu, 2012;
Kashyap & Stein, 2012).

Monetary policy transmission. Central bank can use open market operations, policy
interest rates, or reserve requirements to influence short-term interest rates on the
interbank market in order to conduct monetary policy. They aim at price stability so that
there must be a process to transmit monetary policy changes into real economic
variables, this process may result in multiple transmission channels with different levels
(Afandi, 2005a; Agha, Ahmed, Mubarik, & Shah, 2005; Aleem, 2010; Andrieş &
Stoica, 2014; Angeloni & Ehrmann, 2003; Baglioni, 2007; Barran, Coudert, & Mojon,
1996; Beck, Colciago, & Pfajfar, 2014). Studies on monetary policy transmission have
been implemented in many countries and areas (Mishra & Montiel, 2012), almost all
previous studies confirm that monetary policy transmits through interest rate channels,
exchange rate channels, asset price channels, credit channels, and expectation channels
(Dabla-Norris & Floerkemeier, 2006; Honda, 2004; Mukherjee & Bhattacharya, 2011).

Bank lending channel. In contrast to traditional channel of monetary policy
transmission (such as interest rate channels, exchange rate channels, and asset price
                                            15


channels), bank lending channels focus on the impact of monetary policy on bank credit
supply (Altunbas et al., 2002; Altunbas et al., 2012).

       Monetary policy → fund of commercial banks → credit supply → investment,
                      consumption → aggregate demand → output
   Thus, this study is going to investigate the monetary policy transmission and bank
lending channels in Vietnam that is presented in 5 chapters. The next section presents
the detail of each chapter in this study.


1.7.    The structure of study

This study is structured as

   Chapter 1: Introduction. This chapter firstly collects and then analyses monetary
policy and the effects of monetary policy on macroeconomic variables in Vietnam from
2000 to 2012. It finds that Vietnamese monetary policy was expansionary in the 2000
– 2007 period, yet it has changed and fluctuated in the 2008 – 2012 period. The
fluctuations in Vietnamese monetary policy impacted on other economic variables
strongly, especially in and after the 2008’s global financial crisis. Market interest rates
are changed in line with policy rates, while money supply had increased highly over a
long period from 2000 to 2007 lead to high inflation in 2008 – 2012. Through analysis,
this chapter suggests that Vietnam may have interest rate channel, while exchange rate
channel and asset price channel may be weak, and bank lending channel may be strong.
Then it shows the necessary objectives and questions of this study. In which, this part
presents more detail on some main concepts in monetary policy, monetary policy tools,
monetary policy targets, monetary policy transmission, and bank lending channels.

   Chapter 2: Theoretical framework and Literature review. This chapter presents a
fully detailed literature review on monetary policy transmission and bank lending
channel. It summarizes that monetary policy transmits through interest rate channel,
exchange rate channel, asset price channel, credit channels, and expectation channel. In
which, a bank lending channel is an important sub-channel of a credit channel with
some existence conditions: enterprises depend on bank loans, commercial banks can’t
                                            16


replace all funds from deposits, central banks can impact on bank credit supply and
some other conditions.

   Chapter 3: Methodologies. This chapter presents methodologies that are used for
monetary policy transmission and bank lending channel testing. It finds that we can use
policy rates or money supply to proxy for monetary policy, yet policy rate is a better
indicator. In studying monetary policy transmission, time series data is the main kind
of data that is used with certain conditions in relationship between economic variables.
Econometric models which are suitable with time series data in studies of monetary
policy transmission are VAR, SVAR, FAVAR, ECM, VECM, ARDL, DSGE, GMM,
and some other models. In which, VAR and SVAR have the advantage of measuring
time series data and GMM has the advantage of measuring panel data. From this basis,
this chapter goes to build models for empirical studies: VAR and SVAR are used to test
interest rate channel, asset price channel, and exchange rate channel by monthly time
series data, while the system GMM model is used to test bank lending channel by annual
panel data.

   Chapter 4: Empirical evidences from Vietnam. This chapter presents results of
monetary policy transmission testing and bank lending channel by using statistical
models from chapter 3. Through VAR and then SVAR, this study finds the evidence of
cost channel in Vietnam, and that this study does not find the evidences of exchange
rate channel and asset price channel. Meanwhile, bank lending channel is strong and
affected by characteristics of commercial banks including size, capital, and it is also
affected by the 2008 global financial crisis. This study goes further to test the robustness
of results by recruiting money supply (M2) to replace for VNIBOR in VAR and SVAR
models, and rediscount rate and refinance rate for VNIBOR in GMM model. This study
finds that M2 is not a good proxy for Vietnam monetary policy, meanwhile results are
not change in models with rediscount rate and refinance rate.

   Chapter 5: Conclusions and policy implications. This chapter goes to conclusions
and gives some recommendations that are based on experiences in the world, situation
                                            17


in Vietnam, and results of this study. This chapter also goes to clarify its limitations and
suggests some new direction studies.

       THEORETIAL FRAMEWORK AND LITERATURE
                     REVIEW

2.1.       Monetary policy
           2.1.1. Introduction

      Enterprises, households, individuals, and governments have strong interactions with
each other in a complicated economic system that reflect through fluctuations in
inflation, unemployment, production, and macroeconomic policies. Economic
decisions of each household and individual have minor effects on economic elements,
but macroeconomic policies such as monetary policy have strong impacts on
widespread economic elements (Bernanke, 2004; Sims, 1992; Uhlig, 2005). Monetary
policy is expressed in many aspects, it has seen as actions that were undertaken by
central bank to alter money supply or policy rates to aim at inflation stability, economic
growth, fully employment, and exchange rate stability (Araújo, 2015; Drakos &
Kouretas, 2015; Sánchez, 2012), but policy makers must ensure a balance between
money supply and output (M. Friedman, 1987; Lucas, 1980), which is presented as
according to the equation:

                                        MxV=PxY                   (2.1)

where: M - monetary supply, V - money velocity in circulation, P - average price
level, Y - real output.

      If real output doesn’t react to changes in money supply, policy makers shouldn’t try
to change money supply because it will change the price instead of real output (Begg et
al., 2008). Money supply is defined as M1, M2, M3, and M4 in England; M1, M2 in
US; M1, M2, and M3 in Europe and Japan 3, and it depends on monetary base which is
supplied by central bank and the monetary multiplier which is created by the banking
system activities, therefore money supply depends on monetary policy and banking

3
    See more detail about money supply definition in Appendix 1
                                                       19


system operations. Money demand depends on the demand of private sectors including
incentives to keep money for transactions, hedging, speculation and public sectors
including demand for expenditure and investment (B. M. Friedman, 1956). A change in
money supply or money demand will alter nominal market interest rates so that the
central bank changes money supply or policy rates to influence on nominal market
interest rates to conduct monetary policy (B. M. Friedman, 1981).

           2.1.2. Central bank 4

      Central bank is monopolized for printing and issuing money, it is also the
government bank, the bank of commercial banks, the lender of last resort, the manager
of payment system, the agency for monetary policy implementation, and the supervisor
of the banking system. Central bank acts as the bank of government and the bank of
commercial banks in deficit funding, credit activities, and other financial activities.
Central bank is also the lender of last resort which helps avoid crashes in the financial
system (Diamond & Dybvig, 1983). Central bank also manages foreign exchange
reserves to ensure the stability of exchange rates and the economic stability with
external shocks (Chowdhury, Hoffmann, & Schabert, 2006). Finally, central bank plans,
implement and supervise monetary policy which is called monetary policy conducting
(Blinder, Ehrmann, Fratzscher, De Haan, & Jansen, 2008; B. M. Friedman, 1999).

           2.1.3. Monetary policy targets

      Central bank conducts monetary policy to aim at economic stability, optimal
unemployment, financial system stabilizing, but price stability is always the most
important target 5 (Cecchetti & Krause, 2002; Geraats, 2002; O. Issing, 2004; Jean Louis
& Balli, 2013; Spyromitros & Tuysuz, 2012; Van der Cruijsen & Demertzis, 2007). In
order to achieve price stability, full employment, economic growth, central bank has to
focus on intermediate targets such as money supply (M1, M2 or M3), short-term and
long-term interest rates (Flood & Isard, 1988; B. M. Friedman, 1976; Rogoff, 1985).

However, they have to accept some trade-offs in monetary policy conducting such as
the trade-off between inflation and unemployment (Gali & Monacelli, 2005; Herring &
Marston, 1977; Otmar Issing, 2003; A. W. Phillips, 1958). Central bank conducts
monetary policy to achieve price stability through three main tools: open market
operations, policy interest rates (in short: policy rates) and reserve requirements.

           2.1.4. Monetary policy tools

Policy interest rates. Central bank uses different policy rates to conduct monetary
policy such as rediscount rate, and interbank offer rate. Central bank cuts policy rates
to expand monetary policy and vice versa.

                    Policy rates → market interest rates → economic activities
       Currently, there are different types of policy rates around the world 6. In monetary
policy conducting, the limitation of this tool is that central bank has to wait for a
response from the market. Instead, central bank can use open market operations which
has a direct impact on money supply and market interest rates.
Open market operations. Central bank buys or sells short-term securities on the open
market to directly impact on money supply and money demand thereby it has an effect
on market interest rates and other economic elements (Thành & Hằng, 2008).

     Open market operations → money base → money supply → market interest rates

       Central bank uses open market operations quite often nowadays 7. Besides open
market operations, central bank also uses reserve requirements to impact on money
creation mechanism in the banking system in order to conduct monetary policy.

Reserve requirements. Central bank uses mandatory reserve requirements to impact
on money supply since reserve requirements have a direct influence on the monetary
creating multiplier that is created by banking system 8.

    See more detail about reserve requirements in Appendix 8
                                           21


Reserve requirements → cash leakage → money creating multiplier → money supply
                                → market interest rates

   Central bank usually uses more than one tool to conduct monetary policy such as
raise policy rates combined with selling securities on the open market and increasing
reserve requirements to tighten monetary policy. However, monetary policy is not
always effective in promoting price stability, economic growth, and job optimization as
expected (Mengesha & Holmes, 2013).

       2.1.5. The ineffectiveness of monetary policy

   Central bank may ease monetary policy to prevent the economic downturn by
reducing policy rates to stimulate investment and consumption then increase aggregate
demand and output (Moss, 2007). Nevertheless, expansionary monetary policy
sometimes can’t stimulate economic growth due to the liquidity trap (Dieppe &
McAdam, 2006), due to individuals and households may decide to hold cash rather than
other assets when the interest rate closes to zero, money demand will simultaneously
increases with money supply therefore expansionary monetary policy can’t stimulate
investment and consumption anymore. Deflation is also another problem in monetary
policy conducting. In a deflated environment, real interest rates are higher than nominal
interest rates thus real borrowing costs will be higher than nominal costs so that
investments will be limited even when interest rates drop to near nil (Bernanke & James,
1990). Besides monetary policy, fiscal policy is also an important macroeconomic tool.
The interactions between monetary policy and fiscal policy are important in influencing
aggregate demand and the economic activities (Lucas Jr & Stokey, 1983; Mankiw &
Taylor, 2011).

       2.1.6. Monetary policy and fiscal policy

   Through expansionary fiscal policy, government increases spending, decreases
taxes or does both simultaneously to stimulate investment and consumption (Moss,
2007). However, the expansion of government spending increases budget deficit and
interest rate then reduce investment and consumption in the private sector, which is
known as “crowding out effects” (Abrams & Schitz, 1978; Cebula, 1978). In fact,
                                            22


monetary policy and fiscal policy can’t substitute each other because monetary policy
impacts on money supply and interest rates to influence aggregate demand, while fiscal
policy impacts on aggregate demand through government spending and taxation.

   The expansionary fiscal policy in combining with the contractionary monetary
policy: interest rates will increase, while output may increase or decrease which is
dependent on the total effect of both policies by aggregate demand.

   The contractionary fiscal policy in combining with the expansionary monetary
policy: output can increase, decrease, or not change, while interest rates will decrease.

   The expansionary fiscal policy in combining with the expansionary monetary policy:
both policies will increase output, while interest rates can increase, decrease, or not
change.

   The contractionary fiscal policy in combining with the contractionary monetary
policy: output will decrease, while interest rates can increase, decrease, or not change.

   The interactions between monetary policy and fiscal policy affect the effectiveness
of overall macroeconomic policies in many countries (Buti, Roeger, & In't Veld, 2001;
Buti, Roeger, & Veld, 2001; Leith, Moldovan, & Rossi, 2015; Melitz, 2000). In fact,
price stability, economic growth, job creation, and financial system stability are easily
achieved by neither monetary policy nor fiscal policy, thus policy makers have to
smooth the coordination between them in macroeconomic policy conducting.
Nowadays, with more innovations in financial markets and the economy, central banks
also try to innovate monetary policy to adapt with new situations (Chortareas &
Noikokyris, 2014; Girardin & Moussa, 2011; Lyonnet & Werner, 2012).

       2.1.7. Unconventional monetary policies
              2.1.7.1. Quantitative easing program

   Quantitative easing program (QE) is an unconventional monetary policy to cope
with the deflation and near nil interest rate situation by the central banks in Japan, U.K.,
and U.S. Central banks enact quantitative easing by purchasing without reference to the
interest rate a set quantity of bonds or other financial assets on financial markets from
                                                          23


private financial institutions. The goal of this policy is to increase money supply rather
than to decrease the interest rate, which can’t be decreased further in a near nil interest
rate or deflated economy. QE was firstly conducted in Japan from 2001 to 2005 when
they were faced with stagflation (Girardin & Moussa, 2011). After the 2008’s global
financial crisis, some central banks conducted QE such as the Bank of England in 2009 9,
Fed in many times (QE1 in 2008 10 with the value up to 1,700 billion US dollars, QE2
in 2010 with the value up to 600 billion US dollars, the QE3 in 2012 with the value up
to 40 billion US dollars per month) to deal with crisis and stimulate economic growth.

       The real effects of QE remain controversial, yet it helped curb and prevent the crisis
and promote economic growth in Japan (Girardin & Moussa, 2011), but it couldn’t do
the same in the case of the U.K. (Lyonnet & Werner, 2012), while the effectiveness of
QE in the U.S. is still being argued now. QE is evidence of innovations in monetary
policy conducting, and inflation targeting (Svensson, 1999).

                    2.1.7.2. Inflation targeting policy

       Inflation targeting policy originated in New Zealand in 1989, then many countries
have applied this policy, such as Chile, Canada, Israel, England, Sweden, Finland,
Australia and Spain (Svensson, 2000). Until 2011, over 29 central banks have applied
the inflation targeting policy around the world 11 (Hammond, 2012). In inflation
targeting, central banks set an inflation target for monetary policy, and then will do
anything to achieve this target. Inflation targeting policy has three important
characteristics (Svensson, 1999):

       -   Central bank defines inflation target.
       -   Central bank has a clear policy framework for economic decision-making and
           inflation target decision-making.
       -   Central bank has transparency and responsibility.

                                                           24


       After defining the inflation target, central bank has to conduct monetary policy in
order to achieve this target 12. People will look at the central bank activities to follow,
which then creates inflation expectation in the economy. Inflation targeting policy
requires independence, transparency, and responsibility of the central bank. It needs the
people's confidence in the central bank since people will change their inflationary
expectations differently from the central bank’s target if they don’t trust in the central
bank, thus inflation targeting policy will fail (Roger, 2010). Information transparency
is required in inflation targeting policy due to its various benefits (De Haan, Eijffinger,
& Waller, 2005) such as the confidence of people in the central bank policy (Svensson,
2003), the stability of economic expectations (Eusepi, 2005), the low cost of the crisis
(Chortareas, Stasavage, & Sterne, 2003; M. Dai & Sidiropoulos, 2008), low and stable
inflation (Demertzis & Hughes Hallett, 2007; Van der Cruijsen & Demertzis, 2007),
and the stability of macroeconomic (Spyromitros & Tuysuz, 2012).

           2.1.8. Summary

       Central banks conduct monetary policy to aim at price stability, economic growth,
full employment, and financial system stability. However, central banks can’t achieve
all targets once, there are some tradeoffs between targets such as inflation and
unemployment. Central banks conduct monetary policy through policy rates, open
market operations, and reserve requirements to impact on aggregate demand through
intermediate variables such as market interest rates, exchange rates, asset prices, and
expectations. Monetary policy may not take effect in the case of deflation, liquidity trap,
or near nil interest rates. These situations bring some difficulty for central bank in
monetary policy conducting so that the quantitative easing program and inflation
targeting policies are launched to cope with these situations. Although the QE program
has been implemented in Japan, England, and U.S., it is still argued about their
effectiveness. Meanwhile, inflation targeting policy is a new trend in the monetary

policy conducting since the early 1990s, but we must have an independent central bank
with high reliability and transparency to make inflation targeting policy effective.



2.2. Monetary policy transmission
           2.2.1. Conceptual framework

       Monetary policy transmission is the process that transmits the changes in policy
rates or money supply to a series of other changes in economic variables such as market
interest rates, asset prices, exchange rates, cash flow, bank credit supply, private
spending and consumption, etc. and ultimately aims at price, output and
unemployment 13 (Mankiw & Taylor, 2011). Monetary policy transmission mechanism
is different from country to country 14. It transmits monetary policy through a variety
of economic variables including interest rate, credit supply, exchange rate, asset price
in the U.S. (Kenneth N Kuttner & Mosser, 2002), through market interest rates, asset
prices, exchange rates, and market expectations in the U.K. (Committee, 2013), through
market interest rates, exchange rates, asset prices and expectations in South Africa 15,
through interest rates, asset prices, exchange rates, credit, and expectations in Thailand
(Disyatat & Vongsinsirikul, 2003), or through interest rates, exchange rates, and credit
in Vietnam (Thành & Hằng, 2008).

       Interest rate is one of the most important variables in monetary policy conducting.
The relationship between the interest rate and economic variables is outlined in IS – LM
model (investment/saving - liquidity preference/money supply) by Professor John
Hicks (Hicks, 1937), which is based on previous analysis of Professor John Maynard
Keynes (Keynes, 1936). The IS – LM model explains the equilibrium between the
interest rate and real output in terms of fixed price assumption. In his analysis, Keynes

assumes that the goods price is fixed and each element of aggregate demand (including
private consumption (C), investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports
(NX)) are a function of other economic variables.

       The IS – LM model includes IS curve and LM curve. IS are created from the
interaction between the changes in the interest rate in the case of constant supply in the
goods market 16, while LM is created from the interaction between the changes in money
demand in the case of constant money supply in the money market 17. The combination
of IS and LM forms the overall equilibrium on both the goods market and the money
market, in which the intersection of IS and LM forms the equilibrium in both output
and interest rate. Suppose that central bank increases money supply, LM will shift to
the right (LM1 to LM2), the equilibrium will be shifted following (Y1 to Y2), the new
equilibrium has a lower interest rate (i2 < i1) with higher output (Y2 > Y1) (see Figure
9.3 in Appendix 9). Thus central bank can conduct monetary policy by changing money
supply or interest rates to impact on output and other economic variables. In addition,
other elements of aggregate demand can shift IS then change the overall equilibrium 18.
The changes in money supply or policy rates of central bank have an effect on other
economic variables; in the IS – LM model it is the basis of monetary policy transmission
that forms many transmission channels.

           2.2.2. Monetary policy transmission channels

       Although, the interest rate channel is seen as the traditional channel of monetary
policy (Bernanke & Blinder, 1992), monetary policy also transmits through other
channels 19 (Cecchetti, 1999; Ganev, Molnar, Rybinski, & Wozniak, 2002), that are
found in many countries and areas 20 (Mishra & Montiel, 2012; Mishra, Montiel, &
Spilimbergo, 2010), in which interest rate channels (IRC), exchange rate channels

(ERC), asset price channels (APC), credit channels (CC), and expectation channels
(EC) are seen as main channels (Dabla-Norris & Floerkemeier, 2006; Disyatat &
Vongsinsirikul, 2003; Honda, 2004; Mugume, 2011; Mukherjee & Bhattacharya, 2011;
Wulandari, 2012).

               2.2.2.1. Interest rate channel

   Central bank may change money supply and/or policy rates to alter real interest
rates, investment, aggregate demand, and output.

       Monetary policy → real interest rate → investment, consumption → output

   In Keynes analysis, he emphasized on investment decisions which also depend on
real interest rate, but durable goods consuming decisions are also affected by real
interest rates. Thus IRC transmits monetary policy through long-term real interest rates
that effect on both investment and consumption decisions. Why does central bank
usually use short-term policy rates to conduct monetary policy?

   When central bank decreases short-term policy rates, the nominal short-term interest
rates on the market will decrease as follows:. Due to the term structure of interest rate
and the sticky price, long-term interest rates are predictive values of future short-term
rates so they will decrease following the decrease of short-term interest rates and then
the expected long-term interest rates will also decline (Andersson, Dillén, & Sellin,
2006; Cook & Hahn, 1989; Evans & Marshall, 1998; Carlo A. Favero, Iacone, & Pifferi,
1996; Haldane & Read, 2000; Kenneth N. Kuttner, 2001; Lindberg, Mitlid, & Sellin,
1997), therefore central bank uses short-term policy rates to conduct monetary policy.
In addition, in the case of deflation and a near nil nominal interest rate, monetary policy
is still effective if the central bank focuses on the real interest rates rather than the
nominal interest rates. Central bank can conduct an expansionary monetary policy by
increasing the money supply to raise the expectation of inflation, the increase in
inflation expectation reduces real interest rates thus stimulate investment and
consumption.

       The interest rate channel is confirmed by many studies as the main transmission
channel of monetary policy in many countries and areas (Cecchetti, 1995; B. M.
Friedman, 1956; Timothy H. Hannan & Liang, 1993; Taylor, 1995). Numerous studies
found evidences of IRC in many countries such as U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria,
Turkey, Indonesia, Thailand, and other countries 21, IRC does not only exist in
developed economies such as countries in G7 group but also in developing countries
such as Malaysian, Indonesia, Thailand, and Turkey. In fact, monetary policy can
transmit through interest rate channel and other channels at the same time (Ramlogan,
2007). However, financial markets must be developed to make IRC effective, some
countries such as U.K. and U.S. have highly-developed financial market so that IRC is
the most important channel (Allen & Gale, 2004; Engert, 1999; Franklin & Gale, 2000).
Sometimes, interest rate channels don’t transmit monetary policy immediately because
market interest rates react slowly with a decreased step to the changes in policy rates
due to the low development of financial markets (Toolsema, Sturm, & de Haan, 2001).
IRC sometimes doesn’t play an important role in the monetary policy transmission in
Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania due to the low-developed financial markets (Buigut,
2009). Sometimes, interest rate channel do not exist, such as in Eritrea. Mengesha and
Holmes (2013) found no evidence of IRC in Eritrea, a small country in Africa, because
Eritrea doesn’t have a developed financial market, while their commercial banking
system dominates their financial system. The main tool of monetary policy in Eritrea is
reserve requirements, their central bank doesn’t use policy rates and open market
operations anymore therefore the rediscount window doesn’t exist, while interest rates
and credit supply hardly change and IRC does not exist.

       Summary, we can understand that central bank usually implements monetary policy
by changing short-term policy rates to change the expected long-term interest rates
which has an impact on investment and consumption, this is the transmission
mechanism of IRC. However, IRC needs certain conditions in financial markets,
banking system for existing; IRC needs highly developed financial markets and a

developed information technology in order to make it efficient. IRC is also lagged and
often uncompleted, it lags from 3 months to 2 years and may be longer.

                    2.2.2.2. Exchange rate channel

       Besides IRC, ERC is also an important channel of monetary policy transmission
(Demir, 2014; Golinelli & Rovelli, 2005), which transmits monetary policy through
exchange rate to trade and investment activities, and other international shocks, thus
ERC will be almost ineffective in a closed economy. ERC also includes the impact of
interest rates because the decrease in domestic real interest rates makes domestic
currency less attractive and it will depreciate versus the foreign currency (Pennings,
Ramayandi, & Tang, 2015), which makes export prices cheaper from a foreign point
of view while import prices are more expensive from a domestic point of view thus
the export will increase and the import will decrease and vice versa.

       Monetary policy → real interest rate → exchange rate → net export → output

       Besides that, if central bank tightens monetary policy, the domestic currency value
appreciates then the domestic currency price of import goods will decrease, thus the
inflation will fall since domestic manufacturers will be simulated to decrease their
prices to compete with cheaper import goods (Cwik, Müller, & Wolters, 2011).
Empirical studies confirm that ERC is an important transmission channel besides IRC
in many countries 22 such as Golinelli and Rovelli (2005) in Czech Republic, Hungary
and Finland; Karasoy, Kunter, and Us (2005) in Turkey; Kierzenkowski (2005) in
Finland; Faust and Rogers (2003), H. Bjørnland and Halvorsen (2008), H. C. Bjørnland
(2009) in European. However there are some cases such as Eritrea, Mengesha & Holmes
(2013) didn’t find evidence of ERC, but they found the existence of ERC in the illegal
foreign exchange market. Most developing countries have strong intervention of their
central banks into the foreign exchange market and their economies have poor links
with international financial markets as well as lack of debt and capital security markets
so that ERC is weak or even doesn’t exist (Clements, Kontolemis, & Levy, 2001;


22
     See more studies in table 13.2 of Appendix 13
                                             30


Mishra & Montiel, 2012). Uganda is a case of this situation (Mugume, 2011), or Czech
Republic, Hungary, Poland (Creel & Levasseur, 2005).

   The impact of international shocks on domestic economies are stronger in an open
economy therefore ERC will be stronger if a country opens up their economy more
(Cachanosky, 2014; Chen, Imbs, & Scott, 2009; Hooper, Mann, & Bryant, 1993).
However, it may not be true in some cases (Erceg, Gust, & López-Salido, 2007),
because enterprises will be more competitive in price-making decisions to compete with
import goods, so they must think careful before changing prices to avoid losing market
share to import goods so they are less responsive to monetary policy (Chen et al., 2009).
Sometimes, ERC is unclear because it depends on the domestic and foreign interest rate
expectations (Mishkin, 1995). We can’t make sure that a country with higher domestic
interest rates will have a more attractive currency (Gonçalves & Guimarães, 2011),
higher interest rates may lead to higher inflation expectations thus the domestic
currency will lose value rather than increase in theory (O. Blanchard, 2004).

   In summary, ERC transmits monetary policy through exchange rates to import and
export activities. It is affected by the economic openness, but the real effect is
controversial. Most studies agree that the economic openness will effect ERC but there
are still some cases economists found no significance statistical evidence, some studies
argue that ERC will be stronger in a more open economy, some others do not agree at
all. Furthermore in some cases, ERC is weaker than other transmission channels,
especially when central bank controls and intervenes strongly into the foreign exchange
market.

              2.2.2.3. Asset price channel

   In the case of ineffective ERC, monetary policy can be transmitted through asset
price channels. APC has two related mechanisms: Tobin's q theory and wealth effect,
both mechanisms are related to the relationship between the asset price with investment
and consumption.

   Tobin's q theory was developed by Professor James Tobin. In Tobin’s studies (1969)
it explains the impact of monetary policy on financial asset prices and on other
                                           31


economic variables. Tobin suggested that the q ratio, which is equal to a ratio of firm
market values on asset replacement costs, to investigate the investment activities of
enterprises. A higher q ratio means the market value is higher than the asset replacement
cost so new asset purchasing will be cheaper than market value. Enterprises would be
willing to issue new shares to purchase additional assets for their operations, these
actions increase private investment, output and vice versa.

          Monetary policy → asset price → q ratio→ investment → output

   The asset and the wealth of individuals and households decide their consumption
behavior (Ando & Modigliani, 1963). While interest rates effect financial asset prices
then effect the wealth of households and individuals and their spending decisions. Once
central bank tightens monetary policy, the asset price will decrease due to the increase
in the interest rate. The view of individuals and households is that their wealth is
devalued and diminished. To ensure the safety and long-term balance in income and
expenditure, households and individuals will cut their spending now, these actions
decrease aggregate demand, output and vice versa.

    Monetary policy → asset price → wealth decrease → consumption → output

   Asset price channel is one of the important channel in monetary policy transmission
(Mishra & Montiel, 2012; Mukherjee & Bhattacharya, 2011). APC exists in most
developed countries, yet it just exists in a few developing countries due to the lack of
debt and equity security markets (Mishra & Montiel, 2012). Asset price channels not
only transmit via stock prices but also through other asset price such as real estate.
People spend much of their income for houses (Maki & Palumbo, 2001), meanwhile
real estate also plays as people’s wealth (Case, Quigley, & Shiller, 2005), it is also a
storage medium so that the real estate price reacts to changes in macroeconomic factors
such as interest rates (Bernanke & Kuttner, 2005; H. C. Bjørnland & Jacobsen, 2010;
Elbourne, 2008; Rigobon & Sack, 2004; Zettelmeyer, 2004). Monetary policy can
transmit through housing prices by both indirect channels or direct channels in which
the direct channel transmits through income and cash flow, and the indirect channel
                                                     32


transmits through wealth effects of commercial bank credit 23 (Elbourne, 2008). The
wealth effect is an important channel in monetary policy transmission (Boivin, Kiley,
& Mishkin, 2010), it will be stronger in a deflated economy (Pigou, 1943), it also affects
the labor market and the currency market (Ando & Modigliani, 1963), and it is strong
in developed countries such as the U.S. 24 (Fair, 2004; Lettau, Ludvigson, & Steindel,
2002), while it is weaker if a country borrows more debt (De Andrade & De Castro
Pires, 2011).

       Summary, APC is an important channel of monetary policy transmission; it
transmits monetary policy to investment and consumption through Tobin's q theory and
wealth effect. APC not only transmits through stock prices but also through real estate
and other assets, it is stronger if asset prices are more volatile (Ogawa, Kitasaka,
Yamaoka, & Iwata, 1996; Ogawa & Suzuki, 1998).

                    2.2.2.4. Credit channel

       Besides IRC, ERC, and APC, a group of sub-channels in monetary policy
transmission is the credit channel. Credit channel includes bank lending channels
(BLC), balance sheet channels (BSC), cash flow channels (CFC), unexpected price
level channels (UPLC), and household effects liquidity (HLE). These sub-channels are
quite diversifiable from IRC, ERC, and APC because they mainly focus on the impact
of monetary policy on commercial bank credit and balance sheets of enterprises and
households (Bernanke & Gertler, 1995; Ciccarelli, Maddaloni, & Peydró, 2014; M.
Iacoviello & R. Minetti, 2008; Kashyap & Stein, 1995; Ramey, 1993).

Bank lending channel – BLC

       If borrowers can’t have access to financial markets, they can get loans from
commercial banks therefore commercial banks will transmit monetary policy through
their credit supply. When central bank expands monetary policy, commercial banks will



23
     See more detail in figure 13.1 of Appendix 13
24
     See more studies in table 13.3 of Appendix 13
                                           33


supply more credit for enterprises and households to invest and consume (Altunbas et
al., 2002; Aysun & Hepp, 2013; Disyatat, 2010).

  Monetary policy → funds of commercial banks → credit supply → investment and
                                 consumption → output

Balance sheet channel – BSC

   Balance sheet channel acts as a supplemental channel for the bank lending channel.
BSC transmits monetary policy through the effect of asymmetric information problem
in the credit market. When central bank tightens monetary policy, the increase in the
interest rate will decrease the asset value of enterprises, thus enterprises are more
incentive to participate in riskier projects because of the adverse selection and moral
hazard problems, which increase the default probability of enterprises and decrease the
loan recovery probability of commercial banks so that they will respond by cutting
credit supply (Aysun & Hepp, 2013; De Bondt, 2004).

   Monetary policy → asset price → moral hazard and adverse selection → credit
                   supply → investment and consumption → output

   We should note that the balance sheet channel impacts on credit demand of
enterprises which differ from IRC, because IRC directly impacts on investment
decisions through interest rates. In addition, the balance sheet channel is based on
nominal interest rate while IRC is based on real interest rate.

Cash flow channel – CFC

   Cash flow is the difference between the inflow and outflow cash of a project or an
enterprise. Cash flow of an enterprise will be improved if the central bank eases
monetary policy; the higher cash flow improves the quality of balance sheets thus
improving the credit rating of enterprises so that commercial banks are willing to
increase credit supply. Cash flow channel is also bases on a short-term nominal interest
rate like BSC (Bernanke & Gertler, 1995).

       Monetary policy → interest rate → cash flow → moral hazard and adverse
         selection → credit supply → investment and consumption → output
                                             34


Unexpected price level channel – UPLC

   UPLC transmits monetary policy through the impact of monetary policy on the
overall price level. Because payments for debts are usually fixed in the borrowing
contract, the increase in the overall price level will reduce the real value of liabilities,
while the real asset value of enterprises have no loss that increase the net worth of
enterprises, thus commercial banks are willing to lend more (Bernanke & Gertler, 1995;
Mishkin, 1995).

  Monetary policy → unanticipated price level → net worth of enterprise → moral
 hazard and adverse selection → credit supply → investment, consumption → output

Household liquidity effects – HLE

   BLC, UPLC, and BSC all focus on investment activities of enterprises without
paying attention to the consumption of households and individuals. In contrast, HLE
describes the monetary policy transmission through consumption activities of
households and individuals. Because the durable goods and real estate assets are low-
liquidity assets, if there is a disadvantage shock from monetary policy, households and
individuals need to sell their assets to get liquidity, they will suffer a big loss in
comparison to their actual asset value when they have durable goods or real estate. If
households and individuals hold various kinds of financial assets such as cash, foreign
currency, stocks, and bonds, they can easily sell these assets at market value. Therefore,
once households and individuals face instability in the future, they will have fewer
tendencies to hold illiquid assets such as durable goods, or real estate, meanwhile
households and individuals’ perceptions about the future depends on their own current
assets and liabilities. Therefore, if the price of their financial asset increases, households
and individuals will spend more on durable goods and real estate because their liquidity
situations are better, which will then increase the aggregate demand and then output
(Christiano, 1991; Christiano & Eichenbaum, 1992). Thus, HLC transmits monetary
policy as following: an expansionary monetary policy will decrease the interest rate,
then increase the price of financial assets, then simulate individuals and households
                                                   35


spending more on durable goods and real estate, then increase aggregate demand and
output.

             Monetary policy → interest rate → household liquidity → durable goods
                                consumption → consumption → output

       Therefore, the credit channel has 4 sub-channels: BLC, BSC, UPLC, and HLC that
transmit monetary policy through the effects of monetary policy on credit supply of
commercial banks (BLC), or credit demand of enterprises, households and individuals
(BSC, UPLC, HLC) then effect other economic variables (Ashcraft & Campello, 2007;
Bernanke & Gertler, 1995; De Bondt, 2004).

       Most studies about the credit channel have focused on large countries with
comprehensive national data such as the U.S. and European countries; they mainly
focus on two main channels: the balance sheet channel and the bank lending channel 25.
Credit channel is found in U.S. (Bernanke & Blinder, 1992; Kashyap & Stein, 2000;
Kishan & Opiela, 2000; C. Liu & Minford, 2014; Orlowski, 2015), in European
(Altunbas et al., 2002; Altunbas et al., 2009; Chrystal & Mizen, 2002; B. t. Mojon,
Smets, & Vermeulen, 2002), and many countries. It is proved as an important channel
of monetary policy transmission besides IRC (Bernanke & Blinder, 1992; Christiano,
Eichenbaum, & Evans, 1996; Romer & Romer, 1989). Because IRC requires highly-
developed financial markets for existence so that credit channel will be more important
in the country that has low-developed financial markets (Ramlogan, 2007; Wulandari,
2012), or credit channel will be clearer and stronger in an economy which primarily
provides capital through the banking system (Bernanke & Gertler, 1995).

                    2.2.2.5. Expectation channel

       Beside IRC, APC, ERC, and credit channel, financial markets also transmit
monetary policy through expectations on economic situation, inflation and risk (Kohn
& Sack, 2003), (Mukherjee & Bhattacharya, 2011). Expectation channel is hard to work
separately because it helps exaggerate the effects of other channels. Before Mukherjee

25
     See more in table 13.4 of Appendix 13
                                                     36


and Bhattacharya (2011), the study of Dabla-Norris and Floerkemeier (2006) also
mentioned about expectation as a channel of monetary policy transmission. Through
people's confidence in the central bank's policy and other macroeconomic policies,
expectation channel transmits the monetary policy through the expectations of people.
The mechanism of expectation channel can be understood as the transparency and
creditability of the central bank in monetary policy conducting which influences the
expectation of people, enterprises, households and individuals. These expectations
affect investment decisions of enterprises and consumption decisions of individuals
then alter the aggregate demand and output 26.

     Monetary policy transparence and credibility → people’s confidence in monetary
             policy→ future expectation → investment and consumption → output

       Expectations in the expectation channel are differed from expectations in IRC.
Expectation channel transmits monetary policy through people's expectations about the
efficiency, reliability, and transparency in monetary policy conducting; meanwhile
expectations in IRC are expectations about long-term interest rates when central bank
changes short-term interest rates. Evidence of expectation channels are found in some
studies such as Dabla-Norris and Floerkemeier (2006), Mukherjee and Bhattacharya
(2011), and (Kohn & Sack, 2003) so it needs additional evidence to be more reliable.

           2.2.3. The lag and effectiveness of monetary policy transmission

       Despite widespread impact of the monetary policy on economic elements, economic
characteristics such as law system, banking system operation, asset and liability
structure of commercial banks, financial market structure, and many other factors have
strong effects on the reaction of economic elements to monetary policy. It creates lag
and sometimes ineffectiveness of monetary policy transmission.

                    2.2.3.1. The transmission lags of monetary policy




26
     See more detail in figure 13.2 of Appendix 13
                                           37


   Prices do not react consistent to monetary policy. Price usually reacts slowly to
monetary policy and it lags for about a year (Christiano, Eichenbaum, & Evans, 1999;
Goodhart & Hofmann, 2001; Hülsewig, Mayer, & Wollmershäuser, 2009; B. Mojon,
2001; Harold Sander & Kleimeier, 2002). Sometimes, price quickly changes after the
change in policy rate (Barth III & Ramey, 2002), yet this change may not take place on
the whole territory of a country, monetary policy may transmit with difference levels to
different states, some states may react quicker and some others may react slower
(Carlino & DeFina, 1996), it is due to the difference in economic conditions between
states and the kinds of monetary policy (Dedola & Lippi, 2005; Disyatat &
Vongsinsirikul, 2003; Timothy H Hannan & Berger, 1989; Timothy H. Hannan &
Liang, 1993; Krusec, 2010).

   Monetary policy transmission usually lags. Retail interest rates and other
intermediate targets are needed time to adjust to monetary policy shocks thus monetary
policy transmission is lagged (C. E. Borio & Fritz, 1995). Sometimes, retail interest
rates respond slowly with the decrease in policy rates, while they respond quicker to the
increase in policy rates (Mester & Saunders, 1995). Especially, interest rates in the
terms of deposits and demand deposits respond slower with changes in policy rates,
while lending interest rates response faster (De Graeve, De Jonghe, & Vennet, 2007).
In summary, the lag of monetary policy transmission is due to (Toolsema et al., 2001):

   -   The agency cost in economic elements (Stiglitz & Weiss, 1981).
   -   The cost for economic plan adjustments (Cottarelli & Kourelis, 1994).
   -   The cost to change operations (Klemperer, 1987).
   -   The cost of risk sharing (Fried & Howitt, 1980).

   Monetary policy transmission is lagged from 3 months to 1 year or more. For
example, there is only a 30% change in ECB's policy rate transmission via lending rates
of commercial banks within one month (Burgstaller, 2003) and this transmission occurs
entirely from 3 to 10 months (de Bondt, 2002). However, commercial banks sometimes
react stronger than normal, interest rates sometimes go up to 110% in comparison with
                                          38


the changes in ECB's policy rate and this transmission takes place within 3 months to 2
years (Cottarelli & Kourelis, 1994).

   The transmission lags of monetary policy are different between countries. For
example, the German and Italian commercial banks raise their interest rates slower than
the Spanish and France commercial banks when ECB raises the policy rate, and German
and Italian investments also fall slower than in Spain and France (B. Mojon &
Peersman, 2003). In U.K., depositary interest rates hardly change with market rates and
are lagged (Heffernan, 2002). In Asia, monetary policy transmission via IRC is fairly
low in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Taiwan (Scholnick, 1996;
Wang & Lee, 2009).

              2.2.3.2. The effectiveness of monetary policy transmission

   Monetary policy is not transmitted fully in the long term and in almost all countries
due to transmission barriers (de Bondt, 2002), it is affected by the volatility of the
interest rate (Haughton & Iglesias, 2012). Evidences of not fully transmission are also
found in U.S (Atesoglu, 2003; Kwapil & Scharler, 2010), in Australia (Burgstaller,
2003), in Greece (Chionis & Leon, 2006), and many countries.

   This section has presented in clear detail about monetary policy and monetary policy
transmission, in which the bank lending channel is important in emerging markets such
as Vietnam. The next section presents more detail on the bank lending channel, the
existing condition, and the determinants of this channel.



2.3. Bank lending channel
       2.3.1. Introduction

   As one of the main transmission channels in the credit channel, bank lending channel
supplements IRC to strengthen the impact of monetary policy on economic variables
through bank credit supply. This section will present more information for a better
understand the BLC.
                                           39


       2.3.2. Transmission mechanism

   Sometimes, monetary policy may be ineffective in reducing long-term real interest
rate which is important in long-term investment decisions (Bernanke & Gertler, 1995),
thus monetary policy will be transmitted through bank lending channel (Bernanke &
Gertler, 1995). Commercial banks are the main financial institutions which provide
funds for all economic elements. Enterprises, especially small and medium enterprises,
will be have difficulty in maintaining operations if commercial banks cut credit supply
(Gertler & Gilchrist, 1993). Thus, if central bank tightens monetary policy, funds of
commercial banks are decreased, if they are difficulty in issuing debt and equity
instruments to offset the decrease in funds, they have to cut their credit supply and vice
versa (Bernanke & Blinder, 1988).

    Monetary policy → funds of commercial banks → credit supply → investment,
                                 consumption → output

       2.3.3. Existing conditions

   BLC bases the ability of commercial banks in credit supply, so that it will exist with
some certain conditions in the economy, commercial banks and customer
characteristics:

   Enterprises depend on funds from commercial banks (Bernanke & Blinder, 1988).
If enterprises are fully funded by equities or loans from financial markets, they won’t
need loans from commercial banks thus BLC won’t exist. Commercial banks can’t
replace entire funds from deposits (Bernanke & Blinder, 1988). If non-deposit funds of
commercial banks are perfectly elastic, commercial banks can mobilize other funds to
replace funds from deposits, thus their credit supply are not affected by monetary policy
(Bernanke & Gertler, 1995). Central bank can impact on credit supply of commercial
banks (Kashyap & Stein, 1995). This condition depends on many factors such as the
transparency, creditability and independence of central bank or the power of central
bank. However, all the above conditions can be violated in reality. In a country with a
highly developed financial market, enterprises can borrow loans from financial markets
rather than from commercial banks so that BLC is weaker or limited (Saxegaard, 2006).
                                                     40


In addition, if commercial banks can raise funds from other sources, they can balance
the impact of monetary policy on deposit funds and react more flexibly to monetary
policy shocks (Romer & Romer, 1990).

           2.3.4. Empirical evidences

       In fact, commercial banks can’t entirely replace funds from deposits (Dibooglu &
Kutan, 2001), therefore BLC is found in many countries as an important channel that
amplifies the effects of IRC (Bernanke & Blinder, 1988; Bernanke & Gertler, 1995) and
APC (G. R. Hubbard, 1995). The first study mentioned BLC as a channel of monetary
policy transmission was Bernanke (1986) and then other studies such as Bernanke,
Lown, and Friedman (1991), Bernanke and Blinder (1992), Kashyap, Stein, and Wilcox
(1993), and many studies have done with more details 27.

       BLC is found in Japan (Asako, Kuninori, Inoue, & Murase, 1989; Hayashi & Inoue,
1991; Hoshi & Kashyap, 1990; Ogawa & Suzuki, 1998), in South Korea (Ferri & Kang,
1999; H. E. Kim, 1999), in Germany (Barran et al., 1996; De Bondt, 2004; Michael
Ehrmann, 2004; Ehrmann & Worms, 2004; Holtemöller, 2003; Hulsewig, Winker, &
Worms, 2001; Kakes & Sturm, 2002; Von Kalckreuth, 2001; Worms, 2001), in
European (Altunbas et al., 2002; Altunbas et al., 2009; Altunbas, Gambacorta, &
Marques-Ibanez, 2010b; Altunbas et al., 2012; Angeloni & Ehrmann, 2003; Apergis &
Christou, 2015; Bredin, Fitzpatrick, & Patrick, 2001; Burgstaller, 2003; Cantero-Saiz,
Sanfilippo-Azofra, Torre-Olmo, & López-Gutiérrez, 2014a; de Bondt, 2002, 2004;
Kleimeier & Sander, 2000; Leroy, 2014; Petturson, 2001; Harold Sander & Kleimeier,
2002; Harald Sander & Kleimeier, 2004; Toolsema et al., 2001), and in many other
countries such as Indonesia, Canada, Thailand and in South Asia areas (Perera, Ralston,
& Wickramanayake, 2014b).

       Some recent studies have mentioned the cost channel when they study the bank
lending channel (Adolfson, Laséen, Linde, & Villani, 2005; Gaiotti & Secchi, 2006), it
transmits monetary policy through the effect of credit supply on lending interest rate


27
     See more studies in table 13.5 of Appendix 13
                                           41


and then effects on input capital cost of enterprises (Tillmann, 2008). Barth III and
Ramey (2002) argued that monetary policy not only effects on demand side but also on
supply side of the economy through the cost channel. The change in monetary policy
will alter the credit supply and lending rates of commercial banks, this process alters
the marginal product cost and then affects output prices of enterprises (Chowdhury et
al., 2006; Ravenna & Walsh, 2006). However, the transmission of the cost channel is
different between industries. Barth III and Ramey (2002) found that the cost channel is
the most important channel in some industries in the U.K. due to these sector
characteristics. That is consistent with the study of Dedola and Lippi (2005), they found
that sector characteristics affect monetary policy transmission, and GDP is affected by
impacts of monetary policy on both sides of supply and demand. The existence of the
cost channel greatly effects the optimal monetary policy (Ravenna & Walsh, 2006).
Because any change in monetary policy that transmits through IRC and BLC may well
be destroyed if a cost channel exists. So central bank is argued to keep a stable policy
in monetary policy conducting (Chowdhury et al., 2006).

       2.3.5. Determinants of bank lending channel

   Studies of Cottarelli and Kourelis (1994), B. Mojon (2001), Harald Sander and
Kleimeier (2004), De Bondt (2004), and de Bondt, Mojon, and Valla (2005) found that
lending interest rates changes quite closely with policy rates. However, lending interest
rates and credit supply of commercial banks react differently to changes in policy rates
because of the differences in characteristics of each commercial bank (Berger & Udell,
1992). Theoretical and experimental studies have confirmed that BLC is affected by
both macroeconomic and microeconomic factors (Altunbas et al., 2010b; Angeloni &
Ehrmann, 2003), since commercial banks are not only dependent on macroeconomic
factors but also their characteristics in responding to monetary policy (Altunbas et al.,
2012; Loutskina & Strahan, 2006).

              2.3.5.1. Macroeconomic conditions

   BLC is different between countries because of differences in macroeconomic
conditions. Although, central bank may use the same policy tools, monetary policy
                                         42


transmission may differ because of differences in economic conditions and financial
market structure. All IRC, ERC, BLC, BSC, APC, and EC exist in most developed
countries but only some channels exist in developing countries (Mishra & Montiel,
2012). Since most of the central banks in developing countries intervene heavily with
the foreign exchange market, they also have poor links with international financial
markets as well as the lack of debt and capital markets so that ERC, IRC and APC are
usually weak; meanwhile their commercial banks account for almost all finance
operations in their financial markets so that BLC is often strong (Mishra & Montiel,
2012). Haug, Karagedikli, and Ranchhod (2005) found that monetary policy affects
more powerful and longer in New Zealand than Australia because the economy of New
Zealand is smaller and simpler than Australia. In Europe, Germany is found to be the
most powerful transmission country (Gerlach & Smets, 1995), while the effects of the
policy rate on short-term interest rates in Italy is two-times stronger than in Spain
(Dornbusch, Favero, & Giavazzi, 1998). Meanwhile, effects of monetary policy takes
two-times longer in Austria, Belgium, Finland, Germany, and Netherlands, and are two-
times stronger in France, Italy, Portugal, and Spain in comparing to other remaining
countries (Ramaswamy & Sloek, 1998). Elbourne and de Haan (2006) and Héricourt
(2006) also found evidence of the differences in monetary policy transmission in
Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania,
Slovakia, and Slovenia. All of these differences are explained by differences in
macroeconomic conditions.

   BLC will be stronger in small economy with low-developed financial markets. IRC
is weak, while BLC is stronger in a small country with lowly-developed financial
markets such as Uganda (Buigut, 2009), Kenya, Nigeria and Uganda (Saxegaard, 2006).
Studies of Andre Minella and Souza-Sobrinho (2009), Takeda, Rocha, and Nakane
(2005) and Mishra and Montiel (2012) reconfirmed the importance of BLC in small
developing countries. Since developing countries have low-developed, inefficient
financial markets for debt, capital and real estate; their banking systems occupy fund
transferring activities in these economies; and the ratio of financial market value to
gross domestic product is relatively low, their central banks usually intervene deeply
                                           43


into foreign exchange market and their enterprises rely heavily on bank loans so that
BLC is stronger than IRC, APC, and ERC (Disyatat & Vongsinsirikul, 2003; Łyziak,
2001; Mengesha & Holmes, 2013). Conversely, BLC is weaker than IRC and APC in
large economy with high-developed financial markets. BLC is found as a weak channel
in developed countries such as European countries (Clements et al., 2001), or the U.S.
(Mester & Saunders, 1995).

   BLC is affected by locality characteristics. Studies on monetary policy transmission
and BLC assume that all economic agencies receive the same price, however it is not
true in reality. Due to transportation costs and the low speed of price adjustments
(Cecchetti, Mark, & Sonora, 2002) thus monetary policy transmission and BLC are
affected by locality characteristics (Carlino & DeFina, 1996; Fielding & Shields, 2006)
such as the development of province or distance between provinces (Ceglowski, 2003;
Engel & Rogers, 1999).

   BLC may be affected by the economic openness. If a country opens up their economy
more, BLC may be weaker because of domestic economic elements that are more
sensitive to external shocks (Escrivá & Haldane, 1994). Nonetheless, some studies such
as Erceg et al. (2007), Chen et al. (2009), Cwik et al. (2011) have tried to prove the
impact of economic openness on monetary policy transmission but they couldn’t find
significant statistical evidence. Thus, BLC may be affected when a country opens their
economy more.

   BLC is affected by crisis. Gambacorta and Marques‐Ibanez (2011), Mishkin (2009),
and Mishkin (2011) concluded that BLC is stronger in a crisis period other than in a
pre-crisis period because economic elements are more vulnerable in a crisis period. Ferri
and Kang (1999), H. E. Kim (1999) found the same evidence in Korea in the 1997 Asia
crisis. Meanwhile, other studies conclude that BLC loses the effectiveness in a crisis
period such as some Asian countries in the 1997 Asia crisis (Cecchetti, King, & Yetman,
2011; Hesse, 2007), Japan in the 1990s crisis (Hosono & Sakuragawa, 2003; Peek &
Rosengren, 2003), or many countries in the 2008 global financial crisis (Krugman,
2008).
                                            44


   BLC is affected by economic structure. The economic characteristics such as the
scale of the economy, the development of infrastructure impact on the effectiveness of
BLC (Cecchetti, 1999; Ganev et al., 2002). The change in economic structure alters the
effectiveness of BLC and other transmission channels such as the case of Spain after
joining the EMS in 1989 (Juselius & Toro, 2005), or the case of Thailand after the 1997
Asia crisis (Disyatat & Vongsinsirikul, 2003).

   BLC is affected by level of public debt (Cantero-Saiz et al., 2014a). The effective
management of public debt will help balance the overall imbalance spending of a
country over time, public debt also helps balance the inefficiency in the intermediate
financial system (Woodford, 1990). However, if a country uses too much debt, they
have to carry a heavy financial liability, thus they can’t react flexibly to external shocks
so that ERC is stronger than BLC. Brazil is a specific case, their monetary policy lost
effectiveness in the period from 1996 to 2007 when they borrowed too much debt (De
Andrade & De Castro Pires, 2011).

   BLC will be stronger if central bank is more independence. If central bank is more
independence, they will be more transparency and accountability so that they can easily
impact on banking system, thus BLC will be stronger (Dornbusch et al., 1998; Guiso,
Kashyap, Panetta, & Terlizzese, 1999). Besides that people is more confidence in
monetary policy so that BLC will be stronger if central bank is more independence
(Clements et al., 2001; Sala, 2001).

              2.3.5.2. The development of financial markets

   BLC is weaker if financial markets are more development. When financial markets
develop higher, enterprises, individuals, and households can borrow funds from
financial markets instead of commercial banks, the existence condition of BLC is
violated so that it is weaker (Ashcraft, 2001) Elbourne and de Haan (2006).

   BLC is affected by financial market structure. Harald Sander and Kleimeier (2004)
concluded that the effectiveness of BLC depends on the structure of financial market,
they also found that the convergence in the European banking system has made ECB
monetary policy more effective. If banking systems have more kinds of commercial
                                             45


banks, they will change their credit supply less frequency to compete with other banks
so that BLC is weaker.

   BLC is affected by financial transaction cost. The financial transaction cost or the
friction is the cost that incurs in financial transactions such as transaction cost,
opportunity cost, and moving cost. BLC will be stronger if friction is higher. The higher
friction increases the cost in raising funds, enterprises will find it more difficult in
raising funds and they are more sensitive to external shocks so that they will be more
loyal to their banks in credit relationship therefore BLC is stronger (Aysun, Brady, &
Honig, 2013).

   BLC is affected by innovations in financial markets. There have been many new
innovations in financial markets in recent decades such as securitization activities.
Altunbas et al. (2009) found that securitization activities in the early of 21st century at
Eurozone have increased roles of liquidity centers, credit centers, information centers
of commercial banks then impacted on bank credit activities. As commercial banks have
the ability to liquidate their assets through securitization activities so that they can grant
more credit and be more flexible with monetary policy shocks, thus BLC is weaker.
Other innovations which help commercial banks more freely in granting loans will
make BLC weaker.

              2.3.5.3. Regulations in banking sector

   BLC is affected by the capital management and monitoring mechanisms of central
bank. Recent changes in the financial markets are promoting studies on the effects of
central bank’s management and supervision on monetary policy transmission (Bagliano
& Morana, 2012). Regulations of central bank directly affect behavior and reaction of
commercial banks to monetary policy (Honda, 2004), if central bank doesn’t consider
risky actions of commercial banks in monetary policy conducting, commercial banks
can break safety hurdles and join new riskier activities (Zhu, 2007), this makes BLC
stronger and vice versa (Tanaka, 2002). In the late 1980s, the Basel banking supervision
committee issued Basel I to link the minimum capital with the total assets of commercial
banks in order to create minimum capital adequacy standard, then Basel II (2006) made
                                           46


another forward step in safety regulations on minimum capital adequacy. These
provisions raises capital requirements and monitoring activities in the banking system,
they change behaviors of commercial banks and their credit portfolios (Heid, 2007;
Jokivuolle, Kiema, & Vesala, 2009; Koopman, Lucas, & Klaassen, 2005; Peura &
Jokivuolle, 2004; Zhu, 2007). Nowadays, commercial banks have to pay more attention
to risks in credit decision-making that may make BLC weaker (C. Borio, Furfine, &
Lowe, 2001).

   BLC is affected by regulations on interest rate. After the 1930s crisis, Fed
established the Q rule in the 1933 Bank of America Act, which prohibited paying
interest on demand deposits and set ceiling on term-deposits at commercial banks. It
aimed to avoid excessive competition among commercial banks, and restrict
commercial banks to participate in risky investment activities to avoid the collapse of
banking system. After approximately 50 years of implementation, most of these
provisions were removed from 1980 to 1986, these terminations simulated U.S.
commercial banks granting more credit thus BLC was stronger in 1980s in comparison
with the 1960s and 1970s (Dynan, Elmendorf, & Sichel, 2006). Mertens (2008) also
found that regulations on the ceiling interest rate in the U.S. made BLC weaker in
the1960s and 1970s crisis.

   BLC is affected by the transparency of macroeconomic policies. The transparency
in regulation and management of macroeconomic policies makes BLC stronger (De
Haan et al., 2005). If macroeconomic policies are more transparent, the expectations of
people, and enterprises will easily go in the direction that central bank wants, or the
economy easily puts their faith in monetary policy so that BLC will be stronger
(Svensson, 2003).

               2.3.5.4. The competition in banking sector

   BLC will be weaker if the banking sector is less competitive (Leroy, 2014). If the
banking sector is the monopoly competitive market, BLC becomes the amplifying
channel of monetary policy transmission, yet if the banking sector is the oligopolistic
market, other channels are stronger than BLC (Baglioni, 2007; Fungáčová, Solanko, &
                                           47


Weill, 2014). Each commercial bank can focus on a customer segment to build long-
term relationship so that each commercial bank has specific market power. With more
market power, commercial banks are more likely to offer higher interest rates than
market interest rates, so they will respond to monetary policy shocks through interest
rates instead of credit supply, so that BLC will likely be weaker. Nowadays, the banking
system has more large commercial banks with large market shares which i will become
an oligopolistic market (Adams & Amel, 2011; Olivero, Li, & Jeon, 2011).

   The concentration in banking sector is the trend in developing countries. For
example, the concentration indicator shows that market share of 5 largest commercial
banks has increased from 0.42 in 1996 to 0.7 in 2006 at Brazil, from 0.61 to 0.71 at
Chile, from 0.73 to 0.85 at Mexico, from 0.44 to 0.75 at Hong Kong, from 0.49 to 0.62
at Indonesia, and from 0.51 to 0.8 at Korea (Olivero et al., 2011), it happened more
frequently and faster after the 2008 global financial crisis in both developed countries.
CR5 and HHI are popular indexes that are used to measure the competition. They are
seen as the best indexes for competitive measurement (Berger & Hannan, 1989).

              2.3.5.5. Microeconomic determinants

   Besides macroeconomic determinants, BLC is also affected by many
microeconomic determinants (Bernanke & Blinder, 1988, 1992; B. M. Friedman, 1981;
Gertler & Gilchrist, 1991; Hoshi, Kashyap, & Scharfstein, 1993; S. R. King, 1986;
Romer & Romer, 1990). Matousek and Sarantis (2009) found that BLC is different
among the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovak
Republic, and Slovenia due to commercial bank characteristics such as size, liquidity,
capital, ownership structure, and risk.

The size of commercial bank

   BLC is stronger in small commercial banks. Larger commercial banks have a higher
market power and more advantages in customer information; their customers are more
difficult to change banks due to higher costs. While larger commercial banks can assess
more funding sources so that they are less vulnerable and less affected by monetary
policy shocks on credit supply. Meanwhile, small commercial banks have less market
                                             48


power, thus they are willing to pay a higher price to obtain liquidity so that they will be
respond faster and stronger to monetary policy shocks (Altunbas et al., 2002; Altunbas
et al., 2012; Kakes & Sturm, 2002; Kashyap & Stein, 2000).

   Small commercial banks react to monetary policy shocks through credit supply,
meanwhile large commercial banks react through interest rate. Large commercial
banks have the ability to raise funds from various sources in combination with a higher
market power so that their funds are less affected by monetary policy shocks, therefore
they usually adjust their interest rates in response to monetary policy shocks (Chong,
Liu, & Shrestha, 2006). Meanwhile, small commercial banks react to monetary policy
socks through their credit supply, since they have less market power and limit ability to
raise funds.

The capital of commercial bank

   Since capital is important in portfolio diversification, bankruptcy risk minimization,
and bank financial health information (Berger, Herring, & Szegö, 1995), thus capital
requirements have been establishing in nearly 100 countries since 1980 in many
different forms and degrees (Kopecky & VanHoose, 2004a, 2004b). Regulations on
minimum adequate capital ratio is launched at both national and international scope
such as in the U.S. in 1981 (Keeley, 1988; Wall & Peterson, 1996), and in other world
areas in the period from 1988 to 1992 with the initiations of FDICIA and Basel I
(Berger et al., 1995). The increase in the minimum capital ratio requirements has
increased the health of the banking system (John Mingo, 1977; John Mingo &
Wolkowitz, 1977), however capital and risk have relatively weak negative correlation
in distressed commercial banks since they didn’t report the true picture of their financial
health and capital (Gennotte & Pyle, 1991; Koehn & Santomero, 1980). Commercial
banks also forecast the future capital barriers to make their decisions in the current credit
supply thus they effect on BLC (Chami & Cosimano, 2001).

   Commercial banks with capital barriers react stronger to contractionary monetary
policy. Because they are limited in fund raising when central bank tightens monetary
policy so that they respond stronger by cutting credit supply (Altunbas et al., 2002;
                                           49


Kishan & Opiela, 2000, 2006). Meanwhile, they react weaker to expansionary
monetary policy. Because they find it more difficult to attract more funds in comparison
to commercial banks that have no barriers when central bank expands monetary policy
so that they are difficult to increase their credit supply (Brinkmann & Horvitz, 1995; R.
G. Hubbard, Kuttner, & Palia, 2002; Peek & Rosengren, 1995a, 1995b, 1995c). Besides
the size and capital, the liquidity is important in commercial bank activities.

The liquidity of commercial bank

   BLC is stronger at commercial banks with low liquidity. Commercial banks with
low liquidity have less protection from monetary policy shocks, therefore they respond
stronger by changing credit supply to balance liquidity risk (Kashyap & Stein, 1994).
In particular, small commercial banks with low liquidity respond stronger than large
commercial banks (Kashyap & Stein, 2000; Kishan & Opiela, 2000).

   BLC is weaker if the asset of commercial banks has better quality (Peek &
Rosengren, 1995b). Since assets of commercial banks can substitute each other,
therefore if the quality of all assets is better, commercial banks can respond flexibly to
monetary policy     so that BLC is weaker (Kashyap & Stein, 2000). Nowadays,
innovations in derivative products and financial markets have created tools for
commercial banks in reducing the risk and increasing the quality of their assets thus
effect on BLC (Altunbas et al., 2009).

   Loan securitized activities may make BLC weaker. Loan securitized activities help
commercial banks get more liquidity (Gambacorta & Mistrulli, 2004; Kashyap & Stein,
1995; Kashyap & Stein, 2000; Kishan & Opiela, 2000; Peek & Rosengren, 1995b, 2003;
Romer & Romer, 1990; Stein, 1998; Van den Heuvel, 2002a), and reduce risk through
diversifying their portfolios so that they are more flexible in granting loans therefore
BLC is weaker (Altunbas et al., 2009; Greenbaum & Thakor, 1987; Loutskina &
Strahan, 2006). In addition, central bank find it more difficult in managing credit risk
of the banking system and in setting barriers to restrict commercial banks from
participating in riskier activities so that BLC is weaker (Dionne & Harchaoui, 2003;
Donahoo & Shaffer, 1991).
                                          50


   But, loan securitized activities may make BLC stronger. Credit risk and risk in
securitized assets increase the risk of commercial banks so they are more sensitive to
monetary policy shocks (Adrian & Shin, 2009, 2010; Cardone-Riportella, 2010; Uzun
& Webb, 2007).

The risk of commercial bank

   Commercial banks always consider risk factor before responding to monetary policy
shocks. In fact, commercial banks will cut credit supply after a contractionary monetary
policy, but they will always look at their financial health and risk to make decisions
(Bernanke & Blinder, 1988; Bernanke & Gertler, 1995; Kashyap & Stein, 1995;
Kashyap & Stein, 2000; Kashyap et al., 1993). In fact, commercial banks in many
countries have been managing their credit activities more strictly after regulations on
risk and liquidity in the Basel agreement (D. Kim & Santomero, 1988) such as
commercial banks in U.S. (Berger & Udell, 1994; Bernanke et al., 1991; B. J. Hall,
1993; Johnson, 1991; Peek & Rosengren, 1995a, 1995c, 1997), and commercial banks
in Japan (Honda, 2004; Ito & Sasaki, 2002). Commercial banks also forecast monetary
policy to estimate risk factor and make their present decisions (Bofinger, Reischle, &
Schächter, 2001; Cosimano, 1988; Elyasiani, 1995; Mitusch & Nautz, 2001).

   BLC is affected by the risk of commercial banks. BLC will be weaker if the
commercial banks risk increases since they lose their flexibility in grant credit supply
(Hoshi & Kashyap, 2000). However, commercial bank managers may be motivated to
provide more loans with a higher risk to increase profit that is due to moral hazard
problem (Krugman, 2008) so that BLC may be stronger if commercial banks face to
higher risk.

The customer characteristics of commercial bank

   In fact, enterprise operations are affected by funds from commercial banks
(Bayoumi, 2001; Hosono & Sakuragawa, 2003; Kwon, 1998; Ogawa, 2000; Ogawa &
Suzuki, 1998), but their operations impact on their ability to get and repay funds for
commercial banks so that their characteristics will have an effect on BLC.
                                            51


   Commercial banks with different customer segments will react differently to
monetary policy. Commercial banks grant loans to different industries with different
conditions, therefore customer characteristics such as industry cycles, financial barriers,
borrowing capacity, and size of enterprises will affect the BLC (Dedola & Lippi, 2005;
Koop, Pesaran, & Potter, 1996; Peersman & Smets, 2002; Tena & Tremayne, 2009).
Den Haan, Sumner, and Yamashiro (2007) found that consuming and real estate loans
fall sharply while investment and industrial loans increase after a contractionary
monetary policy. Meanwhile, if the central bank tightens monetary policy in the case of
an economic downturn, industrial and commercial enterprises have to borrow more to
finance their inventories so that credit demand will increase despite of contractionary
monetary policy and rising interest rates. Whereas, consuming and real estate loans
decrease because people will cut spending on durable products, real estate immediately
to deal with the economic downturn and rising interest rate (Bernanke & Gertler, 1995).

   BLC is stronger if customers of commercial bank are small and medium enterprises.
Enterprises with different sizes respond differently to monetary policy shocks (Gertler
& Gilchrist, 1993; Gilchrist & Zakrajsek, 1995; Oliner & Rudebusch, 1996), in which
small and medium enterprises are strongly affected by monetary policy through BLC
because they mainly depend on bank loans to operate (Gertler & Gilchrist, 1991, 1993),
and their risks are higher than large enterprises so commercial banks will alter credit
supply for them more than others (B. t. Mojon et al., 2002).

   BLC is stronger if customers of commercial bank have more financial barriers.
Customers, which have more financial barriers, will find it hard to replace bank loans
so commercial banks will not fear about losing customers in changing credit supply
and lending interest rates thus BLC is stronger (Canepa, 2002; Dale & Haldane, 1995).

   BLC is stronger if the industry of customers is more competitive. If industry of
customers is more competitive, customers must maintain competition to avoid risks and
ensure business efficiency, thus they also tend to borrow more to benefit from financial
leverage therefore BLC will be stronger (Lewis & Poilly, 2012).
                                            52


   BLC is affected by the behavior of enterprise managers. Due to moral hazard
problems, enterprise managers try to maximize their interests thus they can accept a
higher interest rate to ensure liquidity and avoid showing outside weakness in the case
of contractionary monetary policy, therefore BLC is weaker. In contrast, managers may
think that the decrease in credit supply is a difficult sign, they will cut investment more
than normal in defense, this makes BLC stronger.

   BLC is weaker if commercial banks have longer relationship with their customers.
Because the relationship with customers is a condition in credit granting (Boot, 2000),
commercial banks will try to avoid large change in loan terms, while their customers
try to avoid changing banks because of the transaction costs (Jenkinson, 1997; B.
Mojon, 2001). In addition, the repetition of credit relationship with customers helps
commercial banks capture more information, reduce the asymmetric information
problem therefore commercial banks will not change their credit supply too much, thus
BLC is weaker (Hachem, 2011).

The ownership of commercial bank

   BLC is stronger at private commercial banks. Despite of privatization trend, state-
owned commercial banks present in many countries around the world (La Porta, Lopez‐
de‐Silanes, & Shleifer, 2002), they have fairly basic differences in customers, operation,
risk (Berger, Klapper, Martinez Peria, & Zaidi, 2008), and lending behavior (Bhaumik
& Piesse, 2008) to private commercial banks. Especially, as state-owned commercial
banks aspire more risk than private commercial banks due to the implied guaranty from
depositary insurance policies (Andries & Billon, 2010; Bhaumik & Piesse, 2008), or
through the government credit policy (Dinç, 2005), so that they will not change their
credit supply much. In fact, private commercial banks often do market research more
than state-owned commercial banks thus they are more sensitive to forecast results
(Bhaumik & Piesse, 2008; Cecchetti & Krause, 2005; Freixas & Rochet, 1997),
therefore they respond stronger to monetary policy shocks (Bonin & Wachtel, 2002;
Weill, 2003).

   Besides state-owned commercial banks and private commercial banks, we can see
the difference in the effectiveness of BLC in other kinds of commercial banks. The
study of Bhaumik, Dang, and Kutan (2011) also found that listed commercial banks are
more influenced by a contractionary monetary policy since they have to be more
transparent, while foreign commercial banks have more negative reactions to a
contractionary monetary policy since they are faced with more domestic barriers. In
addition, subsidiaries, branches, or representative offices of commercial banks are less
sensitive to monetary policy than independent banks (Ashcraft, 2001).

   This is the literature review on monetary policy transmission and bank lending
channels from around the world, and the next section will present some literature review
on this topic in some developing countries that will be the basic for comparing with
Vietnam in this study.



2.4. Studies of monetary policy transmission and bank lending channel in
    developing countries

    Firstly, the proxy of monetary policy in developing countries. The study of
Robinson and Robinson (1997) found that monetary policy in Jamaica was done
through its primary and by all tools but most effective tool is reverse repurchase rate
that exerts significant leverage over the financial system. Study of Ehrmann (1998) at
thirteen European developing countries uses differences interest rates such as 3 month
t-bill rate, 3 month interbank market rate, 3 month money market rate, and 5 day money
market rate to proxy for their monetary policy. The study of Afandi (2005b) about the
monetary policy transmission in Indonesia found that M2 as measure of monetary
aggregate and short-term interest rate is superior to the other specifications. The study
of Goh, Chong, and Yong (2007) in Malaysia indicates that monetary policy operates
mainly through changes in the short-term interest rates, then the one- and three-month
interbank money market interest rates are used as the policy variable in the analysis.
The study of Aleem (2010) states that the repo rate emerged as the major central bank
reﬁnance rate and that also happened at India so they use repo rate of India central bank
                                            54


to proxy for monetary policy. This fact is also found at Namibia (Uanguta & Ikhide,
2002). Recent studies also use policy rates as the main proxy for monetary policy in
developing countries due to the fact that central banks at these countries use policy rates
as the main tool of monetary policy such as in China (Hou & Wang, 2013; J.-Y. Liu,
Lin, Xia, Fan, & Wu, 2015), in developing countries at Euro area (Georgiadis, 2015),
in Algeria (Allegret & Benkhodja, 2015), in BRICS countries (Jawadi, Mallick, &
Sousa, 2016), in emerging markets at Asia (Bhattacharya, 2014). Thus we see that
beside the money supply the policy rate especially short-term policy rates have been
become the main proxy for monetary policy at developing countries as in developed
countries.

    Secondly, the channels of monetary policy transmission. The study of Uanguta and
Ikhide (2002) in Namibia found the evidence of interest rate channel and credit channel,
in which a tightening of monetary policy as evidenced by an increase in the repo or
bank rate causes lending rates to increase in the domestic economy and is reflected in
the shrinkage of private investment with its attendant negative impacts on output and
employment in the short run. The study of Abradu-Otoo, Amoah, and Bawumia (2003)
in Ghana found strong evidence of monetary policy instruments affecting inflation and
output in the Ghanaian economy in the long run and that the exchange rate channel
remains the main medium through which monetary policy transmits. The study of
Golinelli and Rovelli (2005) in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland found the
evidences of the interest rate and exchange rate channels. While the study of Afandi
(2005a) found that consumption spending plays a predominant role in the monetary
transmission mechanisms in Indonesia, and the exchange rate and asset price channels
is weaker than credit channel. The study of Agha et al. (2005) in Pakistan found that the
credit channel is more important than the traditional interest rate channel, they also
found an active asset price channel, but the exchange rate channel has been less
significant by comparison. The study of Buigut (2009) in East African community
found that the interest rate channel may not be so important at this stage for this region,
where the effect of a monetary policy shock on output are similar and seem not
significant, while the effect on inflation though following slightly different patterns are
                                            55


also very small. The study of Aleem (2010) in India found that the lending rate initially
increases in response to a monetary tightening and Indian banks play an important role
in the transmission of monetary policy shocks to the real sector. The study of Mukherjee
and Bhattacharya (2011) in five potential inflation targeting economies in the MENA
region (Egypt, Iran, Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia) and compare it with fourteen
inflation targeting emerging market economies found that the adoption of inflation
targeting did not significantly alter the operation of the interest rate channel in emerging
market economies. In addition, the study of Bhaumik et al. (2011) found that there are
considerable differences in the reactions of different types of banks to monetary policy
initiatives of the Indian central bank, and that the bank lending channel is likely to be
much more effective in a tight money period than in an easy money period. And the
study of Jamilov and Égert (2014) in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, and
Russia found that the interest rate pass-through is systematically incomplete and
sluggish, it means that interest rate channel is weak at there. So, we see that the
monetary policy transmission in developing countries such as Vietnam is difference
country by country, but we are also noted by the evidences of many empirical studies
that the interest rate channel and the credit channel seemly are the main channels in
developing countries, meanwhile the exchange rate channel and the asset price channel
may be weak due to the characteristics of each country. In addition, we can see that the
almost studies did not search or find the evidence of expectation channel in developing
countries due to the lack of data.

    Thirdly, the bank lending channel. Farinha and Marques (2001) directly estimated
loan-supply schedules with variables on cointegration for panel data and concluded that
there is evidence of the existence of a bank-lending channel, and that the importance of
the bank lending-channel is larger for less capitalized banks. The study of Uanguta and
Ikhide (2002) in Namibia found the strong evidence of bank lending channel in credit
channel. The study of Juks (2004) found that the empirical analysis provides evidence
in favor of the bank-lending channel in Estonia, in which well-capitalized banks seem
to experience a smaller outflow of deposits after a monetary contraction, and the
liquidity position of banks seems to be an important determinant of the loan supply
                                           56


suggesting that more liquid banks are able to maintain their loan portfolios, while less
liquid banks must reduce their loan supply after a monetary policy contraction. The
study of Afandi (2005a) found that bank lending channel is stronger than the exchange
rate and asset price channels, but the role of bank lending channel is weaker during the
period before the financial crisis, although stronger than the other two channels in
Indonesia. The study of Horváth, Krekó, and Naszodi (2006) found significant
asymmetric adjustment of loan quantities along certain bank characteristics, but they do
not find any sign for asymmetric loan demand adjustment along these variables, thus
they cannot rule out the existence of the bank lending channel in Hungary. Goh et al.
(2007) found that deposits in Malaysian banks tend to fall following contractionary
monetary policy shocks, but these banks are able to cushion their loan customers from
the reduction in deposits through adjustments in liquid financial instruments thus these
monetary shocks did not depress growth in loans, so this evidence was not found to
support the effectiveness of the bank lending channel for the transmission of monetary
policy. Samkharadze (2008) found the significant interest rate pass-through to the real
GDP and inflation in Georgia, while significance of bank lending channel is partially
supported by the statistical results, particularly only national currency denominated
bank loans have positive effect on output, while total bank loans seem to be insignificant
at there. Matousek and Sarantis (2009) studied BLC at Czech Republic, Estonia,
Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovak Republic and Slovenia and found the
evidence of a bank lending channel in all countries but they vary across countries, in
addition bank size and liquidity seem to play the most significant role in distinguishing
banks’ reactions to changes in monetary policy. de Mello and Pisu (2010) found that
loan supply in Brazilian banks is found to be negatively related to the interbank deposit
certificate rate, suggesting the existence of a lending channel for monetary transmission.
Olivero et al. (2011) studied in 10 Asian and 10 Latin American developing countries
and found that increased competition in the banking sector weakens the transmission of
monetary policy through the bank lending channel. Macit (2012) investigate whether
there is a systematic difference between conventional banks and participation banks in
terms of their response to monetary policy shocks in Turkey and found that participation
                                            57


banks show larger reaction to monetary policy and in terms of bank specific variables,
banks with higher liquidity ratio tend to have higher loan growth, whereas banks with
larger asset size have smaller loan growth. Mora (2013) studied in Mexico and found
that banks with a larger foreign deposit share are more sensitive to foreign (U.S.)
monetary shocks and Mexican country risk, these results indicate the existence of the
conventional bank lending channel. Hou and Wang (2013) examined how banking
marketization affects the transmission of monetary policy through the bank lending
channel in China, and tests whether the relationship between banking marketization and
the transmission of monetary policy changes across heterogeneous banks. They found
that the degree of banking marketization increases, China’s monetary policy
transmission through the bank lending channel weakens, and this works particularly for
large, high profitability, and high capitalization banks. Some recent studies such as
Cantero-Saiz, Sanfilippo-Azofra, Torre-Olmo, and López-Gutiérrez (2014b) analyze
how sovereign risk influences the loan supply reaction of banks to monetary policy
through the bank lending channel in the euro zone which include the banks from
developing countries and found that sovereign risk plays an important role in
determining loan supply from banks during tight monetary regimes, banks in higher
sovereign risk countries reduce lending more during tight regimes. Montes and Peixoto
(2014) evidence about: (i) the “paradox of credibility” which is the new dilemma posed
to central banking in the effort to conciliate monetary policy and banking regulation
under inflation targeting regimes and the risk-taking channel; (ii) the influence of
monetary policies on the risk perception of banks and, as a consequence, on the credit
spread in the Brazil. Perera, Ralston, and Wickramanayake (2014a) found that off-
balance sheet banking reduces the effectiveness of the bank lending channel of
monetary transmission in South Asia. Košak, Li, Lončarski, and Marinč (2015) found
that the high quality of the bank funding strategy (tier 1 bank capital and retail deposits)
and prevalent government backing were crucial to continuous bank lending during the
crisis period. This effect was especially pronounced in non-OECD and BRIC countries.
Adams-Kane, Jia, and Lim (2015) studied the extent to which each channel affected
bank lending in developing countries during the global financial crisis of 2007–09 and
                                            58


found evidence that the liquidity and uncertainty channels were important, although
lending sensitivity to these channels remained unchanged during the crisis. Thus,
through the empirical studies at developing countries we can see that bank lending
channel may or may not exist that depend on the economic conditions at each countries
and it is strongly affected by the bank characteristics. In order to see whether the
monetary policy and bank lending channel are deeply studied in Vietnam, next section
presents the current studies in Vietnam.



2.5. Studies of monetary policy transmission and bank lending channel in Vietnam

   After a period of stable inflation from 2000 to 2007, Vietnam inflation increased to
12% in 2007 and 23% in 2008. Vietnam government determined that inflation
controlling is the primary target of monetary policy in this period. However, monetary
policy in Vietnam also caused negative effects on the economy such as instability
exchange rates, liquidity problems in the banking system, and low GDP growth (Quan
& Dung, 2009). All these factors simulated the studies on Vietnam monetary policy and
the monetary policy transmission in recent years.

   Before 2000, there were not many studies about monetary policy transmission in
Vietnam, some studies mainly used descriptive statistical method, and data comparative
to make recommendations without any quantitative models such as the studies of Weeks
(1998), Lipworth and Spitäller (1993), Fforde and De Vylder (1996), Riedel and Turley
(1999). Later studies about monetary policy in Vietnam have used quantitative models
but they were almost non-significant statistically because of the lack of a database. After
2007, many new economic problems occurred due to joining WTO as well as the impact
of the 2008 global financial crisis which put monetary policy and monetary policy
transmission into attention of policy makers, economists and researchers. All studies of
monetary policy in Vietnam have focused on specific areas such as monetary policy
with inflation, exchange rate, stock exchange, and irregularities in credit streams such
as Leung and Riedel (2001), Vuong and Ngo (2002), Packard (2005), Camen (2006).
The quantitative methods are used more and mainly focus on the short-term relationship
                                          59


between macroeconomic factors such as exchange rates, inflation, market interest rates
with monetary policy through public data that is accessible in Vietnam as an exchange
rate or stock market index.

   Before 2000, Vietnam’s monetary policy was required to achieve many targets that
were set by government (Lipworth & Spitäller, 1993; Riedel & Turley, 1999), and State
bank of Vietnam (SBV) was less independent. Vietnam had two exchange rate regimes
because of economic conditions and the dollarization problem (Fforde & De Vylder,
1996). Vietnams government tightly managed capital flows in and out in this period so
Vietnam had not been affected much by the 1997 Asian crisis as Thailand, Indonesia,
South Korea, and Taiwan (Vuong & Ngo, 2002). After 2000, the perception of
Vietnams government had changed (Camen, 2006). SBV was allowed to manage
monetary policy more independently, Vietnamese government just set targets for the
inflation and monetary policy and also         clarified more detail on the tools and
implementation strategy. However, Vietnam monetary policy transmission mechanism
was a "cloudy picture", inflation was seen as the highest target of monetary policy but
not at all. Channels of monetary policy transmission couldn’t be clearly distinguished
(Packard, 2005). Hung and Pfau (2008) found evidence of "stick price" phenomenon in
Vietnams monetary policy transmission by using the VAR model. They also found that
if SBV raised policy rate, Vietnam stock market was negatively impacted. Fulbright
(2008) found that Vietnams government implemented and coordinated macroeconomic
policies inefficiently. The policy-making agencies of Vietnam are scattered,
uncoordinated, and too sensitive to political pressure. Hossain (2009) found that
Vietnam has a high degree of dollarization alongside China, South Korea, Malaysia,
Thailand, and Cambodia. Vietnamese government used its power to intervene directly
into some sort of price so that the independence of monetary policy conducting in
Vietnam from 1991 to 2005 was the lowest level in 36 countries in Pacific Asia. Thơ
and Tuấn (2013) used data from 1998 to 2012 with the SVAR model to measure the
relationship between monetary policy and inflation in Vietnam but they did not measure
the monetary policy transmission through ERC, APC, and BLC.
                                           60


   Using information from journals, electronic libraries, and doctoral thesis to search
for studies of BLC in Vietnams monetary policy transmission, I haven’t found any
specific detailed study outside of Lân (2012). But the study of Lân (2012) focused on
the transmission channel and the role of the transmission channel as well as the intensity
of the BLC, he didn’t go into the details of characteristics and responses of commercial
banks in the BLC. A number of other studies relate to the relationship between the
monetary policy and commercial banks but they are not completely done and they are
just the work of a master thesis that has not been published, while they just take a short
view on the monetary policy and commercial bank operations and risk.



2.6. Summary and research motivations

   Through the review of studies in monetary policy, the monetary policy transmission
mechanism and the BLC in Vietnam, some points are drawn as follows:

   Studies of monetary policy have been done from the 1990s and thrived in the period
after 2000. However, most of the studies have not applied the quantitative method due
to the weakness of data statistics in Vietnam. Recent studies have used certain models
but they were not abundant and they mainly focused on monetary policy during and
after the 2008 global financial crisis. These studies are also not focused entirely on
monetary policy transmission through all channels. These studies found that Vietnam
monetary policy still has puzzling problems in planning, implementation, performance
measurement, and the independence of SBV. There is almost no deep and careful study
about BLC in Vietnam, but related studies suggested evidence of the existing conditions
for it. In addition, most of the studies do not consider using appropriate statistical
models in testing monetary policy transmission and BLC, thus almost all results are
questionable. Besides that, most studies do not have appropriate data with enough
length of time and variables thus we need a research with appropriate models and
comprehensive data for Vietnam.

   There is clearly a research gap in monetary policy transmission and monetary policy
transmission via BLC in Vietnam; this is why the study: "Monetary policy transmission
                                          61


and bank lending channel in Vietnam” is done. First of all, this study contributes to
the theory of monetary policy transmission, BLC, and determinants of BLC. Through
empirical methods, this study tests the monetary policy transmission through IRC, APC,
ERC, and bank lending channels which define role sand positions of bank lending
channels. These are important for SBV in planning and conducting monetary policy.
This study is also going to discover and analyze the determinants of BLC, especially
characteristics of each commercial bank. It helps define responses of commercial banks
to monetary policy shocks in Vietnam that are highly significant in practical activities
of commercial banks. This studies results are relevant suggestions for Vietnamese
government and other regulators in inspecting and supervising the banking system in
order to avoid system crashes and thus boost the economies sustainable development.

                                       CHAPTER 3
                                 METHODOLOGY

3.1.   Monetary policy transmission testing models
       3.1.1. The relationships between monetary policy, output and inflation

   Monetary economists always try to explain the relationship between monetary
policy, interest rate, aggregate demand, output, and prices in both long-term and short-
term relationships and when we understand these relationships we can explain the
transmission of monetary policy in reality. McCandless and Weber (1995) has
summarized long-run relationships in a 30-year period from 110 countries, with several
definitions of money and they concluded that:

   Firstly, correlation between inflation and the growth rate of money supply is almost
1, varying from 0.92 to 0.96, and it is dependent on the definition of money supply. This
is consistent with many previous studies such as Lucas (1980), Rolnick and Weber
(1994). Secondly, they concluded that there is no correlation between either inflation or
money growth with growth rate of real output. Thus, there are countries with low output
growth, low money growth and low inflation, and countries with low output growth,
high money growth and low inflation. Meanwhile, Bullard (1999) surveyed a lot of
empirical work on the long-run relationships between money growth and real output
and found that while shocks in level of money supply do not impact on real output in
the long-run, this is not the case with respect to shocks in money growth. Despite the
diverse evidence about long-run relationships between inflation and real output, other
economic variables such as unemployment is summarized as: “there is no long-run
trade-off between the rate of inflation and the rate of unemployment” (Taylor, 1996).
Long-run relationships in monetary economics are important for setting up properties
of a theoretical model that match real data. However, understanding short-run
relationships in monetary theory is very important for policy makers. Den Haan (2000)
found that correlations between price and output are positive for short-run and negative
for long-run. However, price is usually assumed sticky in the short-run, a demand shock
                                                         63


would initially raise output above trend, and prices would respond very little. If price is
not sticky in short-run, it could be rising as output falling when economy faces
aggregate supply socks. Therefore, short-run relationships in monetary policy depends
on particular characteristics of policy regime under which monetary policy is conducted
(Walsh, 2010).

           3.1.2. Estimating effects of monetary policy

       Almost all economists accept that long-run effects of money on prices are entire
while other real variables are slightly. Tools have been employed to estimate the impact
of monetary policy evolved overtime because of time-series econometrics development
and changes in specific questions by theory. Since many central banks respond to
economic developments, movements in money supply or interest rate they are not
exogenous, relationships between money supply and economic activities may not
reflect the exact effect of monetary policy on economy.

       Tobin (1970) was the first economist who formally modeled the idea that the
positive correlation between money and output could reflect the opposite view: the
output might be caused by money. Then R. King and Plosser (1984) named that
relationships as reverse causation argument, correlations between broad money such as
M1, M2 and output are endogenous responses of banking sector to economic
disturbances that are not the results of monetary policy actions. The endogeneity
problem seems to be particularly severe if central bank employs short-term interest rates
as their main policy instruments. One of the first time-series econometric studies tries
to estimate effects of monetary policy is M. Friedman and Meiselman (1963). They try
to test the role of monetary policy in determining nominal income through equation28:

 𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡𝑛𝑛 = 𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡 + 𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 = 𝑦𝑦0𝑛𝑛 + ∑𝑖𝑖=0 𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖 𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡−1 + ∑𝑖𝑖=0 𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖 𝑚𝑚𝑡𝑡−1 + ∑𝑖𝑖=0 ℎ𝑖𝑖 𝑧𝑧𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡       (3.1)

where: yn denotes the log of nominal income, equals to the sum of logs of output and
the price level, A is a measure of autonomous expenditures, m is a monetary aggregate,
and z is a vector of other variables relevant for explaining nominal income fluctuations.

28
     They used economic variables in levels, in the modern practice they are used in terms of logs.
                                                            64


Sims (1972) introduced the Granger causality into the research of monetary policy
effects. A variable X has Granger-cause to Y if and only if the lagged value of X has
marginal predictive content in a forecasting equation of Y. In testing the Granger-cause
of money on output, we test whether the ai coefficient equal zero in the regression:

           𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡 = 𝑦𝑦0 + ∑𝑖𝑖=1 𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖 𝑚𝑚𝑡𝑡−1 + ∑𝑖𝑖=1 𝑏𝑏𝑖𝑖 𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡−1 + ∑𝑖𝑖=1 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 𝑧𝑧𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡          (3.2)

       Where important issues include the trend in output and money, the choice of lag
lengths and the set of other variables (z) are involved. Yet the study of Sims (1972) then
Bernanke and Blinder (1992) and B. M. Friedman and Kuttner (1992) concluded that
the interest rate is better in forecasting real output, it means that interest rate is better in
proxy for monetary policy. The studies that used regression to test relationships between
output and money were popularized as Barro (1977) and Barro (1978). Barro divided
the money into anticipated and unanticipated components and found that only
unanticipated part have impacts on real economic variables. Because effects of
macroeconomic variables are usually lagged, we suppose that estimated relationships
between output and money are 29:

               𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡 = 𝑦𝑦0 + 𝑎𝑎0 𝑚𝑚𝑡𝑡 + 𝑎𝑎1 𝑚𝑚𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝑐𝑐1 𝑧𝑧𝑡𝑡 + 𝑐𝑐2 𝑧𝑧𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡               (3.3)

       In this equation, the variation in the money supply (monetary policy shocks) impact
on output. The target of monetary policy is to reduce variations in real output so that
the objective is that money supply should be managed to minimize variations of yt
around y0, then mt should be:
                       𝑎𝑎1              𝑐𝑐2
          𝑚𝑚𝑡𝑡 = −           𝑚𝑚𝑡𝑡−1 −      𝑧𝑧      + 𝑣𝑣𝑡𝑡 = 𝜋𝜋1 𝑚𝑚𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝜋𝜋2 𝑧𝑧𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝑣𝑣𝑡𝑡        (3.4)
                       𝑎𝑎0              𝑎𝑎0 𝑡𝑡−1


       We assume that policy makers forecast z equaling to zero, term vt is the control error
experienced by monetary policy makers in setting money supply. The unpredicted
movement in mt is vt, so equation (3.3) will be:

                        𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡 = 𝑦𝑦0 + 𝑑𝑑0 𝑣𝑣𝑡𝑡 + 𝑑𝑑1 𝑧𝑧𝑡𝑡 + 𝑑𝑑2 𝑧𝑧𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡           (3.5)



29
     See: Walsh (2010), p.15 to p.19
                                                     65


We have 𝑣𝑣𝑡𝑡 = 𝑚𝑚𝑡𝑡 − (𝜋𝜋1 𝑚𝑚𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝜋𝜋2 𝑧𝑧𝑡𝑡−1 ) from (3.4) to put into the (3.5):

𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡 = 𝑦𝑦0 + 𝑑𝑑0 [𝑚𝑚𝑡𝑡 − (𝜋𝜋1 𝑚𝑚𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝜋𝜋2 𝑧𝑧𝑡𝑡−1 )] + 𝑑𝑑1 𝑧𝑧𝑡𝑡 + 𝑑𝑑2 𝑧𝑧𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡

   = 𝑦𝑦0 + 𝑑𝑑0 𝑚𝑚𝑡𝑡 − 𝑑𝑑0 𝜋𝜋1 𝑚𝑚𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝑑𝑑1 𝑧𝑧𝑡𝑡 + (𝑑𝑑2 − 𝑑𝑑0 𝜋𝜋2 )𝑧𝑧𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡                   (3.6)

    Equation (3.3) and (3.6) have the same format, and equation (3.6) derives with
assumption that only unanticipated money shocks have an effect on output. In addition,
coefficients in (3.6) are functions of parameters in (3.4) which represents monetary
policy rule. So that when central bank conducts monetary policy, they change
parameters in (3.4), this change will alter coefficients in (3.6). But Lucas Jr (1976) argued
that relationships are likely change with change in policy regimes. So that equation (3.5)
is not stable with change in policy regimes, thus equation (3.4) implies:

                                  𝑚𝑚𝑡𝑡 = (1 − 𝜋𝜋1 𝐿𝐿)−1 (𝜋𝜋2 𝑧𝑧𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝑣𝑣𝑡𝑡 )

In which L is the lag operator, thus we have equation (3.3):

𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡 = 𝑦𝑦0 + 𝑎𝑎0 (1 − 𝜋𝜋1 𝐿𝐿)−1 (𝜋𝜋2 𝑧𝑧𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝑣𝑣𝑡𝑡 ) + 𝑎𝑎1 (1 − 𝜋𝜋1 𝐿𝐿)−1 (𝜋𝜋2 𝑧𝑧𝑡𝑡−2 + 𝑣𝑣𝑡𝑡−1 ) + 𝑐𝑐1 𝑧𝑧𝑡𝑡
                   + 𝑐𝑐2 𝑧𝑧𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡

= (1 − 𝜋𝜋1 )𝑦𝑦0 + 𝜋𝜋1 𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝑎𝑎0 𝑣𝑣𝑡𝑡 + 𝑎𝑎1 𝑣𝑣𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝑐𝑐1 𝑧𝑧𝑡𝑡 + (𝑐𝑐2 + 𝑎𝑎0 𝜋𝜋2 − 𝑐𝑐1 𝜋𝜋1 )𝑧𝑧𝑡𝑡−1 +
(𝑎𝑎1 𝜋𝜋2 − 𝑐𝑐2 𝜋𝜋1 )𝑧𝑧𝑡𝑡−2 + 𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡 − 𝜋𝜋1 𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡−1                       (3.7)

where output is the function of lagged output, z variables and unanticipated shocks in
monetary policy.

         3.1.3. Database in study of monetary policy transmission

    In studies of monetary policy transmission, data included macroeconomic elements
such as policy rates, money supply, reserve requirement, GDP, unemployment,
industrial production, exchange rate, and microeconomic elements that relate to specific
transmission channels. For example, in the asset price channel we need data of asset
prices, return of financial assets, real estate assets, or in the credit channel we need data
of bank loans, non-performing loans, and loan loss provision. This data usually is
collected from IMF, Worldbank, ADB, and statistic department of each country. The
relevant and accountability of the data will define the significant and goodness of
                                           66


results. However, if we use macroeconomic data from secondary sources, we may face
some problems:

   The inaccurate of data, although data can be collected from reliable sources,
macroeconomic data reflects information of whole economy with many sectors and
elements so that they are affected by statistic technical, time, and data processing. They
may be inaccurate in some level. The out of update data, macroeconomic data has a
collecting procedure and they are announced with the lag, almost studies use past data
which is not updated to the current economy status, so that results of studies may be late
in applying to reality. The omission of data, in developing countries, the statistical
system is weak in capability; so that past data would be difficult to collect thus some
data may be missed. Besides data, proxy variables are important in study of monetary
policy transmission.

       3.1.4. Proxy variables for monetary policy
              3.1.4.1. Policy rates
   According to the traditional economic theory, central banks change money supply
to influence interest rates rather than other economic variables. Nowadays, central bank
mainly changes directly to policy rates to conduct monetary policy thus policy rates are
often used as a good proxy for monetary policy. However, it is easy to choose policy
rates if a country has just used one policy rate, in the case of using many policy rates
such as rediscount rate and refinancing rate, it is more difficult. Bernanke and Blinder
(1992), Kashyap and Stein (1995), Kashyap and Stein (2000) recruited Fed fund rate to
proxy for U.S. monetary policy, because Fed mainly uses Fed fund rate to conduct their
monetary policy. Ehrmann, Gambacorta, Martínez-Pagés, Sevestre, and Worms (2001)
used short-term interest rates for European monetary policy, Gambacorta (2005) used
refinancing rate, Huang (2003) used average rate of four UK's largest banks for
England, while Hofmann and Mizen (2004) used the base rate of the Bank of England.
   The choice of policy rate to proxy for monetary policy depends on the important
level of this policy rate in monetary policy conducting. As in the U.S., Fed fund rate is
the best one because Fed uses this rate to conduct monetary policy. However, in some
cases, we can’t use policy rate, a number of researchers have used the Treasury bill rate
                                           67


to proxy for monetary policy. Ashcraft (2006) proposed if we don’t have short-term
policy rates, we should use the Treasury bill rate instead. Haughton and Iglesias (2012)
also used Treasury bill rate to proxy for monetary policy in the U.S., Asia and Caribbean
countries. When researchers use policy rates to proxy for monetary policy, they
primarily take short-term policy rates. As Ashcraft (2001), Adams and Amel (2011)
argued that central bank changes short-term policy rates to impact on other economic
elements therefore we should use short-term policy rates to proxy for monetary policy.
For example, study of De Andrade and De Castro Pires (2011) used short-term policy
rate of Bank of Brazil to represent Brazilian monetary policy, or Kleimeier and Sander
(2000), Petturson (2001), Toolsema et al. (2001), B. Mojon (2001), Bredin et al. (2001),
de Bondt (2002), Harold Sander and Kleimeier (2002), Angeloni and Ehrmann (2003),
Burgstaller (2003), Harald Sander and Kleimeier (2004) also used short-term policy rate
of European central bank for E.U.
              3.1.4.2. Money supply
   Besides policy rates, money supply is one of the most important proxies of monetary
policy. It is also the intermediate target that central bank aims in monetary policy
conducting. However, the big question of policy makers is whether they should focus
on interest rate or money supply. Using the IS-LM model, Poole (1970) concluded that
policy makers should focus on policy rate if LM is more sensitive, and they should focus
on money supply if IS is more sensitive, but Poole's biggest flaw is that he has ignored
the monetary transmission channel. Total money supply has a direct impact on the
behavior of people, but the transmission is based on the theory of liquidity in which
monetary policy expansion reduces liquidity barrier so that people consume more (B.
M. Friedman, 1956, 1971). So that money supply or interest rates are both important in
monetary policy conducting.
   As the economy grows, the financial market is larger and more important, the role
of the interest rate becomes more important than money supply, and Japan is a typical
example. After the economic crisis in 1990s, Japan fell into stagflation, Bank of Japan
conducted expansionary monetary policy by expanding money supply continuously but
this policy had no effect on Japan’s economy. Palley (1997) detected that changes in
                                              68


money supply have direct impacts on aggregate demand, but money supply and
aggregate demand seem separate today, and IRC becomes the main channel of monetary
policy transmission so that interest rate needs to be considered more. There are still a
number of central banks that conduct monetary policy by changing the money supply,
interest rate, and reserve requirement such as China (Qin, Quising, He, & Liu, 2005),
but most countries focus more on policy rates rather than money supply as before,
Finland is an example (Gottschalk and Moore (2001)). Thus, if a country conducts
monetary policy by focusing on money supply, money supply can be used as a proxy
for monetary policy; in this case researchers often use the broad money supply (M2) to
proxy for money supply. Especially, in the study of the bank lending channel in
monetary policy transmission, the determinants that related to macroeconomic, banking
sector, and the characteristics of commercial banks have strong impacts on bank lending
channel, thus the next section presents more detail on the variables which present for
bank characteristics in the study of this channel.
       3.1.5. Variables of commercial bank characteristics in bank lending channel
   The theory and empirical evidence shows that commercial bank characteristics
effect on monetary policy transmission through BLC (see section 1.4.5 in chapter 1), in
this section we clarify these characteristics. Economists agree that commercial bank
characteristics have impacted on monetary policy transmission via BLC and they use
three variables: scale, capital, and liquidity of banks (Kashyap & Stein, 2000). For
example, Matousek and Sarantis (2009) studied BLC in 8 European countries: Czech
Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovak Republic, and Slovenia
used proxies as: Bank scale (logarithm of total asset), Bank liquidity (ratio of liquidity
assets to total assets, in which total liquidity assets include total cash, deposits at central
bank and other banks, investment securities, and short – term securities), Bank capital
(ratio of bank capital to total assets)

   Studies of Kashyap and Stein (1995), Peek and Rosengren (1995b), Thakor (1996),
Holmstrom and Tirole (1997), Repullo and Suarez (2000), Kishan and Opiela (2000),
Chami and Cosimano (2001), Farinha and Marques (2001), Tanaka (2002), Van den
Heuvel (2002b), Campello (2002), Gambacorta and Mistrulli (2004), Cetorelli and
                                            69


Goldberg (2008), Olivero et al. (2011) and many other studies also take same variables
as above to represent commercial bank characteristics.



3.2.   Econometric models for monetary policy transmission testing
       3.2.1. VAR and related models
              3.2.1.1. VAR model

   Much of the knowledge of monetary policy and monetary policy transmission have
come from the use of vector autoregression. VAR was introduced by Sims (1972) and
Sims (1980), it can be used by macro economists to quantify responses of macro
variables that do not require strong conditions to determine shocks. Then VAR
gradually becomes one of the most popular models used for time-series data over time.
Specifically, VAR is used to measure the dependence and linear correlation between
time-series variables. VAR generalize univariate autoregressive (AR) by allowing more
than one variable involved. All variables in a regression are treated equally under a
structure; each variable will be explained by an equation which includes its lag and lags
of remained variables. VAR does not require a lot of knowledge of factors that effect
on a variable as a structural model or a simulation model, they just assume that variables
in VAR influence others. Therefore, VAR is suitable for measuring the interactions
between macroeconomic variables in time-series data. Because macroeconomic factors
are often self-correlated to its lags and they often interact with others in the network so
that any macro variable can also be affected by other macro variables and vice versa.

   So the VAR model with lag variables of studied variables and other variables will
be easy to measure interactions between macro variables. Monetary policy changes
effect on market interest rates then affect other economic variables, but reactions of
economy elements to monetary policy shocks is different and researchers have to assess
the level and length of reactions. At the same time, researchers also need to forecast
future variances of variables in their studies to clarify the effect of shocks on variances
of forecasted variables to provide suitable policy recommendations. VAR model
provides two tools to solve these problems. IRF (impulse response function) helps
                                             70


researchers measure responses of studied variables to monetary policy shocks. The
variance decomposition helps researchers analyze the contribution of these factors to
variances of studies variables. Although, VAR model does not require strict conditions
but an impulse response function and a variance decomposition which require certain
constraints between the pairs of variables, so researchers have to have a theoretical
background of the relationships between macroeconomic variables.

   A VAR(p) model consists of m variables (endogenous variables), each variable is
expressed as a linear equation with its lag and all lags of remaining variables to p level
and error term, however VAR may have exogenous variables that affect endogenous
variables only. VAR (p) with two variables (x and y) have two detail equations:

        yt = βy0 + βyy1yt-1 +….+ βyypyt-p + βyx1xt-1 +……+ βyxpxt-p + vyt

      xt = βx0 + βxy1yt-1 +….+ βxypyt-p + βxx1xt-1 +……+ βxxpxt-p + vxt              (3.8)

in which: βxyp is coefficient of y for x with p lag.

   If VAR has an additional variable (such as z), model will have one more linear
equation of zt and coefficients of z with p lags will incorporate in to all equations (βxzp).
The important feature of VAR is that xt or yt does not appear on right side of each
equation so sometimes this is not true in reality. Variables in VAR are impacted by
others, so VAR assumes that all variables are endogenous. In the case where all
variables are stationary, OLS estimates will be consistent in estimating coefficients for
VAR. Error terms in equations of VAR represent for the information of yt (or xt) that
can’t be explained by past information of both variables, this is known as unforeseen
shocks of variables. Unforeseen shocks are often correlated with each other because yt
and xt tend to fluctuate together, this is due to the relationships of these variables (or by
influence of other variables that are not incorporated into VAR). Another important
issue in understanding the VAR model and SVAR model is the part of the error term
(part v), exogenous factors, orthogonal shocks of each variable (denoted as ɛ). The error
in yt equation is a part of the variation in y that can’t be predicted by past information
of y and x. The sudden changes in yt is represented by vyt that is caused by ɛyt, which is
an exogenous shock to yt but it is independent with xt and all other variables in the
                                                       71


model. However, sometimes xt correlated with yt, so a portion of vyt indirectly affected
by xt that makes vyt containing both independent shocks and shock caused by xt to yt.

       Study of Bernanke and Blinder (1992) and other studies such as (Auel & de
Mendonça, 2011; Cogley, 2002; Cogley & Sargent, 2005; Cwik et al., 2011; Den Haan
et al., 2007; Disyatat & Vongsinsirikul, 2003; George, Sun, & Ni, 2008; Golinelli &
Rovelli, 2005; S. Kim & Yang, 2012; Krusec, 2010; Mengesha & Holmes, 2013;
Montes, 2013; Tillmann, 2008) used VAR to test monetary policy transmission and
BLC. Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005) concluded that VAR is better in
monetary policy transmission research in a small and medium economy. Richard
Clarida, Galı, and Gertler (1998), R Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (2000), Carlo A Favero
and Marcellino (2001) also proposed using VAR to measure monetary policy
transmission. Mishra and Montiel (2012) concluded that the effective model used to
investigate monetary policy transmission in developed countries is VAR and IRF from
VAR.

       Come back to simple VAR (1) with 2 variables for monetary policy transmission.
Suppose there is a bivariate system in which yt is the natural log of output at time t, and
xt is a measure of monetary policy such as money supply or policy interest rate (in which
short-term policy interest rate is suggested to be as a better measure of monetary
policy 30) (Bernanke & Blinder, 1992; B. M. Friedman & Kuttner, 1992; Sims, 1972).
VAR is

                             𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡           𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡−1  𝑢𝑢𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦

where A(L) is a 2 x 2 matrix polynominal in the lag operator L, and 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a time t serially
independent innovation to the ith variable. These innovations can be thought of as linear
combinations of independently distributed shocks to output (eyt) and policy (ext)

From the (10), 𝑢𝑢𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 = 𝛷𝛷𝛷𝛷𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦 + 𝑒𝑒𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦 , these errors are caused by exogenous output and policy
shocks 𝑒𝑒𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦 and 𝑒𝑒𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 . Let ∑u is the 2 x 2 variance-covariance matrix of 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , ∑𝑢𝑢 = B∑𝑒𝑒 𝐵𝐵′,
where ∑e is the (diagonal) variance matrix of 𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 .

    ext is random variable which represents exogenous shock to policy. We need to
estimate effects of ex on economic variables to define impacts of monetary policy on
economy. If 𝛷𝛷 ≠ 0, innovation to observed policy variable xt will depend both on policy
shock ext and non-policy shock eyt. If 𝛷𝛷 = 0, innovation to observe policy variable xt
will depend only on policy shock ext.

In simplicity, we suppose that 𝛷𝛷 = 0, VAR will be:

                         𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡    𝑎𝑎      𝑎𝑎2 𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡−1    𝑢𝑢𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦
                        �𝑥𝑥 � = � 1         � �𝑥𝑥 � + �𝑢𝑢 �                    (3.11)
                           𝑡𝑡     0       0      𝑡𝑡−1    𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥


With 0 < 𝑎𝑎1 < 1, then 𝑥𝑥𝑡𝑡 = 𝑢𝑢𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 and 𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡 = 𝑎𝑎1 𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝑢𝑢𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦 + 𝑎𝑎2 𝑢𝑢𝑥𝑥𝑡𝑡−1 so that we can
rewrite 𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡 is a MA:

                   𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡 = ∑∞      𝑖𝑖            ∞      𝑖𝑖
                           𝑖𝑖=0 𝑎𝑎1 𝑢𝑢𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦−1 + ∑𝑖𝑖=0 𝑎𝑎1 𝑎𝑎2 𝑢𝑢𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥−𝑖𝑖−1           (3.12)

    When we estimate coefficients in (3.11), effects of uxt on (yt, yt+1, etc.) can be
calculated. If we interpreted ux as an exogenous policy shock, the implied responses of
yt, yt+1,…to policy shock will be: 0, a2, a1a2, 𝑎𝑎12 a2,…this is the way we estimate the
response of economic variables to monetary policy shocks. In the VAR system, we can
estimate effects of a policy shock on output through equation from (3.10) in term of true
underlying structural disturbances ey and ex:
                               ∞                                   ∞

                      𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡 = � 𝑎𝑎1𝑖𝑖 (𝑒𝑒𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦−𝑖𝑖 + Ɵ𝑒𝑒𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥−𝑖𝑖 ) + � 𝑎𝑎1𝑖𝑖 𝑎𝑎2 𝑢𝑢𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥−𝑖𝑖−1
                              𝑖𝑖=0                                𝑖𝑖=0


  = 𝑒𝑒𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦 + ∑∞      𝑖𝑖                                       ∞      𝑖𝑖
              𝑖𝑖=0 𝑎𝑎1 (𝑎𝑎1 + 𝑎𝑎2 𝛷𝛷)𝑒𝑒𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦−𝑖𝑖−1 + Ɵ𝑒𝑒𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 + ∑𝑖𝑖=0 𝑎𝑎1 (𝑎𝑎1 Ɵ + 𝑎𝑎2 )𝑒𝑒𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥−𝑖𝑖−1 (3.13)


    So the true response of y to the exogenous policy shocks ex is:                           Ɵ, 𝑎𝑎1 Ɵ +
𝑎𝑎2 , 𝑎𝑎12 (𝑎𝑎1 Ɵ + 𝑎𝑎2 ), …This response involves the elements of A(L) and the elements of
B, while A(L) can be estimated from (3.9), B and ∑e are not identified without further
                                          73


restrictions. This is why we can use VAR to estimate A(L) from (3.9), but we must set
up matrix restriction for B which develop VAR to SVAR model.

   Studies about monetary policy transmission almost all used secondary data that
collected from various sources for VAR in testing monetary policy transmission.
Bernanke and Blinder (1992) applied VAR with macroeconomic variables: commercial
bank loan, real GDP, and Fed fund rate. Peersman (2004) also used industrial
production growth, inflation, Germany policy rate, and domestic interest rate to apply
VAR for England, Belgium, Austria, Italy, and Spain. VAR model are also used
popularly to study the relationship between the real estate price and macroeconomic
shocks (Assenmacher-Wesche & Gerlach, 2008; Assenmacher-Wesche, Gerlach, &
Nationalbank, 2008; Giuliodori, 2005; Goodhart & Hofmann, 2001; M. Iacoviello,
2005; M. M. Iacoviello & Minetti, 2003; M. M. Iacoviello & R. Minetti, 2008).

   The application of VAR model is relatively flexible in practice, because VAR only
requires assumptions where studied variables interact with each other. For example,
Christiano et al. (1999) found that tightening monetary policy in the U.S. lead to
increase prices, this is opposed to the economic theory, thus many economists suggest
adding variables to VAR model as Sims (1992) proposed adding commodity prices,
Giordani (2004) proposed adding the potential GDP to solve this problem. However,
Jang and Ogaki (2001) asserted if we use VAR model in long term, we don’t need to
add more variables. Instead, economists should include long-term restrictions into VAR
to study monetary policy transmission then VAR can measure long-term impacts in the
form of small data (Faust & Leeper, 1997). In the experimental study of monetary policy
transmission, researchers typically use the VAR model with policy rates, price index,
and variables that represent real operation’s economy. Normally, GDP and total credit
balance are used in the VAR model to measure the transmission of monetary policy
through BLC, while other micro variables are not included to avoid bias in estimating
VAR. However, VAR also has certain limitations. In macroeconomic study, VAR
easily misses variables, it also depends on data or economic theory that can’t be proven
from VAR results despite conditions of VAR may stem from this theory (Van Aarle,
Garretsen, & Gobbin, 2003), and results from VAR sometimes excessive reasonable
                                          74


thus these weaknesses may exaggerate abnormal changes in monetary policy
transmission process. However, the biggest weakness of VAR is that it does not differ
the independent structural shocks and dependent shocks to evaluate responses of
variables to independent structural shocks. So the impulse response function and
variance decomposition for studied variables will not be accurate, thus Bernanke,
Gertler, and Watson (2004) proposed to use a structural VAR model to solve it.

              3.2.1.2. SVAR model
   Besides VAR, structural VAR model (SVAR) is also popularly used in the research
of monetary policy transmission in general and in particular with BLC. Bernanke and
Blinder (1992), Christiano et al. (1996) are pioneer researchers who propose using
SVAR in measuring monetary policy transmission, but O. J. Blanchard (1989), O. J.
Blanchard and Quah (1989) have suggested using SVAR to study effects of supply and
demand on the economy in the long term with controlled conditions to measure accurate
responses of studied variables to shocks earlier.
   Gali (1992) further suggested that control conditions should have more conditions
on both in the short and long term. Bayoumi and Eichengreen (1992) applied SVAR in
Europe to measure impacts of supply and demand shocks in the distinction between
structural and non-structural shocks, then many other researchers also used SVAR as
H. E. Kim (1999), S. Kim (1999), Hoffmann (2007). Other studies also use SVAR to
study monetary policy transmission in Eurozone for U.K., France, Netherlands,
Belgium, Austria, Italy, and Spain (Ehrmann, 2000; Monticelli & Tristani, 1999;
Peersman, 2004; Wehinger, 2000). S. Kim and Roubini (2000) used SVAR to measure
the impact of monetary policy (via interest rate) on GDP and inflation in industrial
countries. Burgstaller (2003) used SVAR model to measure the speed and extent of
monetary policy transmission through interest rate channel in Australia.
   Dedola and Lippi (2005) used data from five industrialized countries of OECD
(including France, Germany, Italy, U.K., and U.S.) to test differences in monetary
policy transmission in different countries and different industries. Ciccarelli and
Rebucci (2006) used SVAR with GDP, inflation, interest rate, and exchange rate for
E.U. Elbourne and de Haan (2006) used SVAR model to test relationships between the
                                          75


financial structure and the monetary policy transmission in European countries. Hesse
(2007) used SVAR model to study the transmission mechanism of monetary policy in
Thailand before and after the 1997 Asian crisis, in order to detect changes in monetary
policy transmission.
   Elbourne (2008) used eight variables with SVAR for the U.K. to test the role of
housing prices in monetary policy transmission and found that housing prices may have
an effect on monetary policy transmission. H. C. Bjørnland and Jacobsen (2010) also
used SVAR model to study the role of housing prices in monetary policy transmission
in Norway, Sweden, and United Kingdom. De Andrade and De Castro Pires (2011) used
SVAR model with variables representing short-term policy rates of Bank of Brazil.
Wulandari (2012) used SVAR for data in Indonesia. Aysun et al. (2013) used SVAR
with data from several countries to identify factors affecting on the intensity of
monetary policy transmission and found that if financial transaction costs are higher,
monetary policy transmission will be stronger, particularly through BLC. SVAR is also
used to study fiscal policy. O. Blanchard and Perotti (1999) used SVAR to measure the
impact of government spending and taxes on U.S. economy after world-war II. Garcia
and Verdelhan (1999) used SVAR to study monetary policy and fiscal policy
transmission in Europe. Dalsgaard and De Serres (1999) used SVAR to measure
impacts of monetary shocks, supply shocks, and demand shocks for 11 European
countries. Bruneau and De Bandt (1999) used SVAR to study fiscal policy transmission
for France and Germany. SVAR is widely used because SVAR helps clarify the
structural shocks and unstructured shocks which standard VAR models can’t clarify,
meanwhile SVAR also provides two tools to analyze monetary policy transmission:
impulse response function and variance decomposition. SVAR is also more prefer in
using for small economies due to:
   -   Small countries have structural changes in economy and institutions thus they
       have both structural and non-structural shocks. VAR can’t help separate these
       two types of shocks, while SVAR can solve it.
   -   Economy macroeconomic factors in small countries are controlled or intervened
       so interactions between macroeconomic variables have certain ties. VAR does
                                           76


       not solve this problem by assuming all variables are interacting with other
       variables which are not clearly defined relationships of one variable with others.
       But, SVAR helps put a restriction matrix in place to bind interactions between
       variables to help define interactions more consistent with reality.

   Despite advantages of SVAR, the simple of VAR has motivated researchers to
develop other models that based on VAR.

              3.2.1.3. FAVAR model
   Besides VAR and SVAR, recent researchers also propose to use Factor Augmented
VAR (FAVAR) to measure monetary policy transmission. Because the use of VAR has
weaknesses so recent studies use FAVAR such as studies of Bernanke and Kuttner
(2005), Vargas-Silva (2008), Gupta and Kabundi (2010). Kazi, Wagan, and Akbar
(2013) used FAVAR to study effects of monetary policy in OECD economies
(including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, U.K., Japan, Australia, Spain, Norway,
Sweden, the Netherlands, Finland, and New Zealand) period from 1981 to 2010.
FAVAR is one of the new approaches proposed by Bernanke, so we need time to verify
the effectiveness and application capabilities in small developing countries like
Vietnam.
       3.2.2. Cointegration models
              3.2.2.1. ECM
   If two or more time-series variables are individually integrated then these variables
are said to be cointegrated. Before the 1980s, many economists used linear regressions
on non-stationary time series data, this is a dangerous approach due to spurious
correlation (Granger & Newbold, 1974; P. C. Phillips, 1986). Then the cointegrating
vector approach was developed to solve this problem in Granger (1981). Error
correction model (ECM), Vector ECM (VECM), and Autoregressive Distributed Lag
model (ARDL) are used to test monetary policy transmission if there are two or more
economic variables which have cointegration.
   ECM is a dynamic system with characteristics that the deviation of current state
from its long-run relationship will be fed into its short-run dynamics. ECM is a category
of multiple time series models that directly estimates the speed at which a dependent
                                            77


variable returns to long-term equilibrium after a change in an independent variable
(Engle & Granger, 1987). ECM is useful for estimating both short term and long term
effects of one time series variable on another. ECM is seen as a model that can use to
measure monetary policy transmission through BLC such as Fountas and Papagapitos
(2001) used this model to find evidence of BLC in Europe.
              3.2.2.2. VECM
   VECM is an innovation of ECM that adds error correction features to a multi-factor
model such as a vector autoregression model. VECM is widely used in studies of BLC
as Hulsewig et al. (2001), Kakes (2000), Calza, Manrique, and Sousa (2003), Calza,
Manrique, and Sousa (2006), R. G. King, Plosser, and Stock (1991), Ehrmann (1998),
Garratt, Lee, Hashem Pesaran, and Shin (2003), Camarero, Ordóñez, and Tamarit
(2002). In which, R. G. King et al. (1991) can be considered as pioneers in VECM
application to measure long-term responses in the economy to monetary policy. de
Mello and Pisu (2010) recently used VECM to study BLC in Brazil in the period from
1995 to 2008 with variables: bank credit balance, interbank offer interest rate, average
lending rate, CPI and bank capital. While Montes (2013) proposed using VECM in
along with VAR and GMM to measure monetary policy transmission.
              3.2.2.3. ARDL

   In the case of cointegration in time series, we must use ECM or VECM to avoid
spurious regression. But ECM and VECM are applied if two or more time series
variables which have cointegrations and they are all stationery at the 1st level. If two or
more series have cointegration but they are not stationery at the same level, we have to
use ARDL. The ARDL of Pesaran and Shin (1998), Pesaran, Shin, and Smith (2001)
has a number of features that many researchers give it some advantages over
conventional cointegration testing. It can be used with a mixture of data stations at level
and 1st different. It involves just a single-equation set-up, making it simple to implement
and interpret. Different variables can be assigned different lags as they enter the model.

   There are some studies which use ARDL in monetary policy transmission such as
Afandi (2005a) in Indonesia, Khan and Sajjid (2005) in Pakistan, Fielding and Shields
                                          78


(2006) in South Africa, Baharumshah, Mohd, and Mansur M Masih (2009) in China,
and Goh et al. (2007) studies BLC in Malaysia.

       3.2.3. DSGE model
   Many researchers study monetary policy transmission using VAR, but Dynamic
stochastic general equilibrium modeling (DSGE) is also used in the case lack of data
(Cogley & Sargent, 2005; George et al., 2008). Shiller, Campbell, Schoenholtz, and
Weiss (1983) can be considered as the pioneer researchers in using DSGE to study
monetary policy transmission. Then research about term premium of interest rate as
Duffee (2002), Q. Dai and Singleton (2002), Ang and Piazzesi (2003), Dewachter,
Lyrio, and Maes (2006) also used DSGE model. Studies of Christiano et al. (2005),
Lubik and Schorfheide (2006), Adolfson, Laséen, Lindé, and Villani (2007), and Smets
and Wouters (2007) all proposed using DSGE to measure impacts of monetary policy.
Dib (2006) used DSGE to test effects of monetary policy through BLC in Canada.
Mertens (2008) used DSGE with data retrieved from the crisis period of 1960s and
1970s in the United States to study the impact of interest rate ceilings on monetary
policy transmission, in view that deposit rate ceiling acts as a barrier to compel banks
to follow. Hülsewig et al. (2009) used DSGE under New Keynesian theory to measure
the role of commercial banks in monetary policy transmission through identified
mechanisms of interest rate loans from the interbank market. Lewis and Poilly (2012)
also used the DSGE model to study impacts of competition intensity in markets on
monetary policy transmission.
   Summary, there are many models to measure the monetary policy transmission in
general and the monetary policy transmission through the BLC. In particular, if we use
the macro variables, the VAR, SVAR, FAVAR, ECM, VECM are appropriate.
However, VAR and SVAR are used in almost all cases, and SVAR have more
advantages than VAR in measuring monetary policy transmission.
       3.2.4. GMM model for panel data

   As presented, most studies in monetary policy transmission have focused on large
and comprehensive national data such as in the U.S., and in European countries; there
are studies in Asian countries such as Thailand, Indonesia, and South America such as
                                               79


Brazil. Studies mainly focus on two sub-channels in credit channel: balance sheet
channel and bank lending channel, in which many studies focus on BLC with different
models 31.

       Researchers also use VAR, SVAR, ECM, VECM, and DSGE to study bank lending
channel, but we usually use micro data from commercial banks to study BLC thus
generalized method of moments (GMM) is more suitable to solve problem relating to
panel data. GMM is often proposed to study monetary policy transmission through BLC
in general and monetary policy transmission through BLC in the case of caring effects
of bank characteristics on BLC. GMM helps to solve endogeneity and other problems
in panel data (Arellano & Bond, 1991a). Takeda et al. (2005) can be considered as
pioneer researchers in using GMM to measure transmission of monetary policy through
BLC, then other studies as Ravenna and Walsh (2006), Chowdhury et al. (2006), de
Mendonça and Lima (2011) use GMM model with more variables including GDP, real
interest rate, credit balance, inflation, exchange rate, public debt, and individual investor
confidence level. In an emerging market such as Brazil, Auel and de Mendonça (2011)
used data from 2002 to 2009 with GMM to measure monetary policy shocks effect on
economy through BLC.

       In panel data estimations, we can use pooled least square (PLS), fixed effects model
(FEM), or random effects model (REM) to estimate parameters. But PLS may give bias
estimations due to heteroskedasticity, autoregression, and endogeneity problems so that
FEM or REM is more suitable in dynamic panel data. A common panel data regression
model is:

                                 yit = a + bxit + ɛit     (3.14)

where y is the dependent variable, x is the independent variable, a and b are coefficients,
i and t are indices for individuals and time, and ɛit is the error term. Assumptions about
error term determine that we use fixed effects or random effects, if ɛit is assumed to vary




31
     See part 2.3 in chapter 2
                                            80


non-stochastically over i or t, we use fixed effects model, if ɛit is assumed to vary
stochastically over i or t, we use random effects model (Hsiao & Maddala, 1999).

   But when we incorporate lagged dependent variable (yit-1) to become an independent
variable into panel data estimation, standard errors is increased by exacerbating any
measurement errors, it leads to a bias in estimating of coefficient of lagged dependent
variable, which is not mitigated by increasing sample (S. Nickell, 1981). And if
regressors are correlated with the lagged dependent variable, their coefficients may be
seriously biased as well due to endogeneity problems.

   The most popular solution is Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) method as
proposed by Arellano & Bond (1991). In the GMM, widely alternatives in within
estimation are methods such as Arellano-Bond differences in Arellano & Bond (1991)
and Blundell-Bond system GMM (Blundell & Bond, 1998). GMM methods are
considered superior to alternatives in handling endogeneity, heteroskedasticity, serial
correction and identification (A. R. Hall, 2003). GMM is used to capture joint
endogeneity of some explanatory variables through a weighting matrix of internal
instruments, which accounts for serial correlation and heteroskedasticity. GMM
estimator technique requires a set of instruments to deal with endogeneity and another
set to deal with the correlations between lagged dependent variables and error terms.
Instruments include suitable lags of endogenous variables as well as strictly exogenous
regressors (Thanh, 2014).

   The GMM estimator requires moment conditions that assume instruments are
exogenous. An equation may be under-identified, exactly identified, or over-identified
depending on whether numbers of instruments are respectively less, equal, or greater
than regressors that are estimated. But, there is no guidance in the literature to determine
how many instruments are too many (Roodman, 2009 ). Roodman (2009) suggests a
rule of thumb that instruments should not outnumber individuals. Through the review
of monetary policy transmission research methods and methods that are used in bank
lending channel, we draw the following key points:
                                            81


   -   Monetary policy transmission depends on country characteristics; this also
       depends on different stages of economy with different results.
   -   Monetary policy transmission is lagged and not entirely over time, industries and
       sectors.
   -   Testing monetary policy transmission requires specialized models for macro data
       such as VAR, SVAR, ECM, VECM, FAVAR, and DSGE. Each model has
       certain constraints; the application of these models depends on actual
       characteristics of data and actual characteristics of specific country. Among these
       models, VAR and SVAR are proposed by many researchers to apply in testing
       monetary policy transmission.
   -   For bank lending channel, we can apply VAR or SVAR for macro data. But,
       when we use micro data such as commercial bank characteristics to test bank
       lending channel, we should use GMM.
   -   Variable proxies for monetary policy are policy rates or money supply which can
       be collected from statistical sources. But proxies for commercial bank
       characteristics such as total assets, capital, and liquidity can be collected from
       financial statements of each commercial bank.

   Based on the results of monetary policy and bank lending channel research models,
this study is going to build models for this thesis in the next section.



3.3.   Research methodologies for this study
       3.3.1. Research procedures and testing hypothesizes

   This study goes into investigating the interest rate channel, asset price channel,
exchange rate channel, and bank lending channel in Vietnam by using three main
models: VAR, SVAR, and GMM in 4 steps (see table 14.1 in Appendix 14). The detailed
processes is as follows:
                                            82


   -   Step 1 and 2

   In order to answer the study’s question 1, this study uses the results from literature
review in chapter 2 to clarify the following testing hypothesizes:

   Hypothesis 1: the interest rate channel exists in Vietnam. Since the interest rate
channel is the main channel of monetary policy transmission that is seen as in sub-
section 2.2.2.1 in chapter 2, IRC is proved that it exists not only in developed countries
but also in developing countries such as Vietnam. In addition, Vietnam is also a small
countries in which the consumption and the investment of public are also depended on
interest rate level that why the interest rate should be existed.

   Hypothesis 2: the exchange rate channel is weak in Vietnam. Since ERC is also an
important channel of monetary policy transmission especial in open countries such as
Vietnam that is reviewed in sub-section 2.2.2.2 in chapter 2 thus it should be existed in
Vietnam. However, the Vietnamese government usually intervenes into foreign
exchange market with many regulations and political actions that may affect to ERC
and make it weaker.

   Hypothesis 3: the asset price channel is weak exist in Vietnam. As seen in sub-
section 2.2.2.3 in chapter 2 the APC is also an important channel of monetary policy
transmission especially in countries which have high – developed financial markets.
But Vietnam has just launched the stock market in 2000 with the small scale and low –
development in addition with the lack of other active financial markets such as the
market for bonds or market for derivatives thus the APC may be weak or not exist in
Vietnam.

   In order to test these hypothesizes, this study builds VAR and SVAR to test three
main monetary policy transmission channels in Vietnam including the interest rate
channel, exchange rate channel, and asset price channel. The impacts of monetary
policy on interest rates then effect on other economic variables are seen as transmission
mechanism of monetary policy, VAR with impulse response function is the appropriate
tool to investigate it. Numerous studies have used the VAR model to study monetary
policy transmission (Auel & de Mendonça, 2011; Cogley, 2002; Cogley & Sargent,
                                           83


2005; Cwik et al., 2011; Den Haan et al., 2007; Disyatat & Vongsinsirikul, 2003;
George et al., 2008; Golinelli & Rovelli, 2005; Hülsewig et al., 2009; S. Kim & Yang,
2012; Krusec, 2010; Mengesha & Holmes, 2013; Montes, 2013; Tillmann, 2008).

   However, VAR still has some drawbacks therefore researchers have developed
SVAR on the basis of VAR to overcome these drawbacks. SVAR requires fewer
conditions than the standard VAR model; SVAR still provides two tools to analyze the
monetary policy transmission: impulse response function and variance decomposition.
In recent years, many studies of monetary policy transmission by SVAR model have
been carried out in the world as O. J. Blanchard (1989), O. J. Blanchard and Quah
(1989), Gali (1992), Bayoumi and Eichengreen (1992), Monticelli and Tristani (1999),
Ehrmann (2000), Wehinger (2000), Peersman (2004). In addition, the SVAR model is
proposed to be used in a small country because SVAR helps to detect and measure
shocks better (S. Kim & Roubini, 2000).

       Thus, this study tests monetary policy transmission through different channels
by VAR and then SVAR with restrictions to test structural shocks in Vietnam.

   -   First of all, this study uses VAR to test monetary policy transmission through the
       interest rate channel, exchange rate channel, and asset price channel.
   -   Then, this study builds SVAR to test all monetary policy transmission channels
       in one system with certain constraints.

   This section aims to assess the importance of each channel in monetary policy
transmission to seek conclusions about monetary policy transmission through
traditional channels in Vietnam. The sections results are a basis for the next sections in
steps 3 and 4.

   -   Step 3 and 4

   After identifying the existence and the important of IRC, ERC, and APC, this study
goes to measure the existence and the impact of commercial bank characteristics on
bank lending channels by using the GMM model with the following hypothesizes:
                                           84


   Hypothesis 4: the bank lending channel is existed in Vietnam. As seen in sub-section
2.3 in chapter 2, the BLC is an important channel in credit channel of monetary policy
transmission, especially in developing countries such as Vietnam which has also
existing conditions for BLC.

   Hypothesis 5: the bank lending channel is affected by bank size, bank capital, bank
liquidity and bank risk. As seen in sub-section 2.3.5.5 the bank characteristics including
the bank size, bank capital, bank liquidity and bank risk have strong effects on BLC.
Meanwhile, Vietnam with many small commercial banks that are new and high
development so these characteristics may have strong role in their loan supply decision
thus affect to BLC.

   Hypothesis 6: the BLC is affected by the 2008 global financial crisis. In fact, the
2008 global financial crisis has strong impacts on all macroeconomic factors of Vietnam
which include the operations and the financial health of Vietnamese commercial banks
so that it may affect to BLC.

   In order to test these hypothesizes, this study recruits the GMM model which has
been used in many previous studies and is considered as an appropriate model for the
bank lending channel with micro data from commercial banks. The GMM model helps
to solve the endogeneity and other problems in panel data analysis (Arellano & Bond,
1991a; Blundell & Bond, 1998, 2000; S. Bond & Meghir, 1994; S. R. Bond et al., 2001).
This study uses data from the banks financial statements including commercial bank
characteristics such as capital, scale, and liquidity of commercial banks which are
considered having impacts on bank lending channel. In fact, small commercial banks
and commercial banks with mainly depositary funds are more responsive to monetary
policy (Altunbas et al., 2012; Kashyap & Stein, 1995); illiquid banks also are more
responsive to monetary policy shocks because they don’t have the ability to defend
themselves from monetary policy changes (Altunbas et al., 2012; Kashyap & Stein,
2000; Stein, 1998); and commercial banks that have less equity are more responsive to
monetary policy because they don’t have enough capital for safety and also not have
                                                85


the ability to access unsecured funding on money markets (Kishan & Opiela, 2000;
Peek & Rosengren, 1995c; Van den Heuvel, 2002b).

       3.3.2. Vietnam monetary policy transmission testing models
              3.3.2.1. VAR model

   As mentioned, there are many studies that use the VAR model to study the monetary
policy transmission, this study is based on the study of Bernanke and Blinder (1992)
and Sims (1992) to test monetary policy transmission in Vietnam. In particular, this
study uses VAR model which is used in study of Aleem (2010). VAR (p) is formed:

                               ∑𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖=0 𝜑𝜑𝑖𝑖 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡−𝑖𝑖 = 𝜃𝜃𝑋𝑋𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑡𝑡   (3.18)
in which: Yt is endogenous vector of domestic variables, Xt is exogenous variables, 𝜑𝜑, 𝜃𝜃
are coefficient vector, ɛ: residual vector.

   Vietnam is a small-open country thus it is impacted by international shocks,
especially shocks from large countries such as the U.S., Japan, and European regions.
This study includes the exogenous vector Xt to represent effects of international shocks
on macroeconomic factors in Vietnam. In addition, international shocks will have a one-
way effect on Vietnam, this means Vietnam will not have opposite effects on these
factors, and it makes international factors become exogenous variables in VAR model.
Exogenous variables include world commodity index (Compiworld), U.S policy rate (ius),
and U.S. output (yus).

                    Xt = [Compiworld              ius       yus]               (3.19)

   Meanwhile, the endogenous vector expresses Vietnam economic factors which
include Vietnam industrial production (IPVN) which presents for Vietnamese output,
Vietnam price index (Prices), and Vietnam monetary policy rate (i)

                    Yt = [IPVN          Prices              i]                 (3.20)

   In order to measure monetary policy transmission through the interest rate channel,
exchange rate channel, and asset price channel, this study also incorporates endogenous
variables which represent each specific channel.
                                            86


   Interest rate channel is proxied by market interest rates (lending interest rate - LER),
the vector Y will be:

                Yt = [IPVN         Prices         i      LER]              (3.21)

   Exchange rate channel is proxied by the nominal effective exchange rate of
USD/VND (NEER), vector Y will be:

                Yt = [IPVN         Prices         i      NEER]             (3.22)

And asset price channel is proxied by VNindex (VNI), vector Y will be:

                Yt = [IPVN     Prices        i        VNI]           (3.23)

              3.3.2.2. SVAR model

   As stated, VAR is suitable for studies of monetary policy transmission, however
VAR also has certain limitations (see section 1.3.1 in Chapter 1), thus researchers
suggest using structural VAR to overcome these limitations (Bayoumi & Eichengreen,
1992; Christiano et al., 1996; Gali, 1992; Hoffmann, 2007; Neri & d'Italia, 2004; Romer
& Romer, 1989). In application, we need to establish a restriction matrix for the
equation system in VAR to construct SVAR model. We also need a solid economic
theory to set restriction matrix that is one of the most difficult to apply using SVAR.
SVAR equation has form:

                               A(L)yt + c = ut        (3.24)

In which: yt is vector of N economic variables, ut is vector of structural shocks that can
be measured, and at least one of these shocks that have the ability to explain, c is vector
of intercept and A(L) is lag operator of coefficients:

                    A(L) = A0 − A1L − A2L2 − .. − ApLp            (3.25)

In which: L is lag of autoregression variables and Ai (i = 0, p) is matrix of N x N.

   The structural shocks are assumed to be uncorrelated and independent pairs together.
The reduced form of SVAR is:

                           yt = c + B(L)yt + ɛt          (3.26)
                                               87


In which B(L) has form:

                           B(L) = B1L + B2L2 + .. + BpLp           (3.27)

And ɛ is vector of residuals. Residuals are related to structural shocks in the form:

                                 ɛt = A0-1ut              (3.28)
   There are many methods to estimate coefficients in SVAR, but all estimation
methods also need restrictions. The simplest method is to use the reduced form of SVAR
and the covariance matrix of VAR residuals through the Cholesky variance
decomposition method (Campbell & Ammer, 1993; Loehlin, 1996; Stock & Watson,
2001; Tanabe & Sagae, 1992). There are more complex methods such as using the short
and long term conditions of Gali (1992),using sign conditions of regression coefficients
or making sign conditions on cross-correlations of Canova and De Nicolo (2000). This
study uses the SVAR model from study of Neri and d'Italia (2004), coefficient matrix
and is defined as:

shocks, shocks from international through exchange rates, output shocks, domestic

Vector u in the left of matrix proxies is the unforeseen changes in economic variables.
In this matrix, Neri and d'Italia (2004) restricted money supply shocks and money
demand shocks, while all others variables are let as S. Kim (1999). SVAR model is
                                           88


determined by the relationship between money supply and money demand according to
equations:

                ɛms = ur + a51ucp + a52uy + a53up + a55um + a56uexc     (3.29)

                       ɛmd = um + a63uy + a64up + a65ur        (3.30)

   In this model, Neri and d'Italia (2004) only used short-term restrictions and
eliminated long-term restrictions because of monetary policy shocks are not only shocks
that affect real economic variables in the long term. In the equation (3.29) and (3.30),
Neri & d'Italia identified supply and demand money functions. In which, money supply
depends on money demand, a nominal exchange rate, industrial production, consumer
price index, and the world commodity prices. As money demand depends on interest
rates, opportunity costs, industrial production, and economic price level. These
restrictions help distinguish monetary policy shocks to money demand shocks. Neri &
d'Italia used the world commodity price index and exchange rate to determine external
shocks on domestic macroeconomic variables. World commodity price shocks and
exchange rates help to avoid reverse phenomenon (price puzzle) that Sims (1992)
mentioned “price level increases when monetary policy tightening”. S. Kim (1999)
assumed that central banks have adequate information about industrial production and
consumer price index when making monetary policy decisions, however this is very
difficult to implement in practice because the data itself will hardly be synthesized
rapidly and regularly up to the time of making policy decisions. Nominal exchange rate
is often used for VAR in a small and open economy because most of these countries
often adjust the exchange rate to policy goals. However, governments of small open
countries usually intervene with the exchange rate so that the exchange rate channel is
usually not an important channel of monetary policy transmission. Smets (1997) used
VAR to study monetary policy transmission conclude that it would be better when he
added exchange rate into the model.

   In their model, Neri & d'Italia set restriction conditions including the world
commodity price index, the nominal exchange rate, consumer price index, and industrial
production. This assumption has been also been mentioned in many studies as
                                            89


Christiano et al. (1996), Bernanke and Mihov (1998). But Neri and d'Italia (2004)
studied for the G-7 (including the U.S., Japan, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada)
and Spain. All countries in his sample have floating exchange rate systems so that
shocks from foreign exchange rates will have an effect on other domestic variables as
an exogenous shocks. However, the exchange rate is one of the monetary policy targets
of the State bank of Vietnam (Goujon, Guillaumont Jeanneney, & Adam, 2002; Riedel
& Turley, 1999; Vuong & Ngo, 2002), so the exchange rate is affected by many other
factors including external shocks. Thus this study still uses SVAR of Neri and d'Italia
(2004), but some modifications in the restriction matrix are made to ensure proper
measurement shocks. Coefficient matrix of SVAR model for this study is built based
on Neri and d'Italia (2004) in this order: world price shock, Vietnam output shock,
money supply shock, money demand shock, exchange rates shock, lending interest rate
shock, stock market price shock, and consumer price index. The SVAR restriction
matrix in this study is formed as:

and p (Vietnam consumer price index). Structural shocks include: ucp, uy, ur, um, uexc, ulr,

                                           90


adjusted from the original model of Neri and d'Italia (2004) for the function of money
supply and money demand:

                    ɛms = ur + a32uy + a38up + a34um + a35uexc      (3.31)

                       ɛmd = um + a42uy + a48up + a43ur          (3.32)

   Money supply depends on money demand, nominal exchange rate, economic output,
consumer price index, and exchange rate. As money demand depends on interest rate,
opportunity cost, industrial production, and price level. In addition, when considering
all three transmission channels: the interest rate channel, exchange rate channel, and
asset price channel, this study takes all three shocks including shocks in market lending
rates, exchange rate shocks, and asset price shocks, in which the function of commercial
bank lending rate will be binding. Lending rates of commercial banks depend on
economic output, policy rate, and money demand.

                       ɛle = ule + a62uy + a63ur + a64um         (3.33)

   After using the VAR and SVAR models to measure monetary policy transmission
through the interest rate channel, exchange rate channel, and asset price channel, this
study uses the GMM model to study bank lending channel, the next section presents
this methodology.

       3.3.3. Bank lending channel testing model

   As explored in chapter 1, studies conducted in the U.S. and Europe provide evidence
of commercial banks in monetary policy transmission. However, most of these studies
were done using VAR with macroeconomic variables; there are not many studies about
bank characteristics in the bank lending channel. Some experimental studies in Europe
prove the effects of bank characteristics and other financial market factors on monetary
policy transmission through the banking system and commercial bank risk in many
different directions (Angeloni & Ehrmann, 2003). At the same time, innovation in
technology and changes in financial markets have changed basic operations of
commercial banks that have also altered the effects of monetary policy through the
bank lending channel (Loutskina & Strahan, 2006). The most recent studies show that
                                                          91


monetary policy impacts on credit growth and commercial bank risks, and these effects
are affected by commercial bank characteristics. Altunbas et al. (2010b) used the GMM
model to study the impact of monetary policy on commercial bank credit growth,
including paying attention to specific characteristics and risk of each commercial bank.
The GMM model is usually used with high relevance in the study of the monetary policy
transmission via the bank lending channel, and assess impacts of bank characteristics
on transmission process due to data that we use including macroeconomic data (related
to monetary policy and other economic variables) and microeconomic data (related to
the characteristics of each commercial bank) that is usually formed as panel data. The
GMM model is proven as the most appropriate method in estimating panel data, GMM
helps to handle the heteroskedasticity, autoregression and endogenous problem in panel
data. The model is used by Altunbas et al. (2010b) has form:

    In which, Loan is outstanding loans of commercial banks, GDP is output, i is policy
rate, EDF is expected default frequency, SIZE is bank size, LIQ is bank liquidity, CAP
is bank capital, LLP is bank loan loss provision. In Vietnam, some studies have studied
the impact of central bank's monetary policy on economic variables such as the stock
market, inflation, trade balance, exchange rate, and GDP growth (Thơ & Tuấn, 2013).
In which, a recent study which studied the impact of monetary policy on the credit
channel is (Lân, 2012). This study used VAR to measure monetary policy transmission
through credit channel and other macroeconomic variables such as inflation, foreign
exchange reserves, and exchange rate, but it did not investigate impacts of bank
characteristics on monetary policy transmission. Based on the study of Altunbas et al.
(2010b), this study applied GMM to test the bank lending channel in relation to
characteristics and risks of individual bank in Vietnam. The model equation has form:
                                             92

    Variables in this model are the same as Altunbas et al. (2010b), loan growth is
affected by monetary policy, in particular through interest rate tool. The decrease in
policy rate will encourage commercial banks to grant more loans, while private sector
has incentive to borrow for consumption and investment therefore loan balance
increases (Bernanke & Gertler, 1995). As economic development, GDP growth
increases disposable income then increases the demand for investment and consumption
accordingly, thus commercial banks will have opportunities to provide more loans
(Kashyap & Stein, 1994). In addition, bank characteristics such as liquidity ratio, bank
size, ratio of equity to total asset, and the ratio of loan loss provision over total asset
have been used in many studies such as scale of total assets (bank size) in Kashyap and
Stein (1995), bank liquidity ratio (LIQ - cash equivalents and investment securities to
total assets) in Stein (1998), bank capital ratio (CAP) in Van den Heuvel (2002b), loan
loss provision (LLP) in Altunbas et al. (2012) when they study BLC. And the interaction
variables between policy rate and bank characteristics are used to test the existence of
the bank lending channel. The expected correlations between variables with the
dependent variable are presented in table 3.3.

   The bank characteristics, macroeconomic control variables, and policy rate variable
are used mainly with a one year lag (t-1) to fit the theory of macro-latency in monetary
policy (Michael Ehrmann, 2004). Simultaneously, ln(loan)i,t-1 and other variables are
integrated with policy rate variable to control endogenous error.

         3.3.4. Research data

   Firstly, the monthly data from 2003 to 2012 which are used in VAR and SVAR
models including world commodity index (Compiworld), US policy rate (ius), and U.S.
output (yus), Vietnam output (IPVN), Vietnam price index (Prices), and Vietnam
monetary policy rate (i), market interest rate (LER), the nominal exchange rate of
USD/VND (NEER), and VNindex (VNI) are compiled primarily from the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), General statistics office of Vietnam, and State bank of Vietnam.
We also collect the SBV’s rediscount rate (RDR), SBV’s refinance rate (RFR), and
money supply (M2) in place of VNIBOR for Vietnams monetary policy rate in order to
test the consistence of VAR and SVAR models. All the data descriptions are presented
more detail in table 3.4.

       Meanwhile, the annual data which uses the GMM model are collected from
financial reports of commercial banks in the 2003 – 2012 period, but some banks do not
have full financial statements so unbalanced panel data is used 32, while the GDP and

3.4.    Summary

   With models that are built based on theories of macro economy plus models that
have been verified by empirical studies in the world. This study takes steps to do a
comprehensive study about monetary policy transmission in Vietnam, particularly
through the bank lending channel. This study uses VAR to test the existence of main
transmission channels in Vietnam. Based on the results of VAR, this study is going to
use SVAR with short-term restrictions to test again Vietnam monetary policy
transmission through main channels in one system. Next, this study uses GMM with
data from financial reports of commercial banks to test the existence of a bank lending
channel. These research methodologies help us to ensure: the monetary policy
transmission is tested by appropriate models and the estimation problems are solved to
avoid mistakes in the conclusions. With models and variables that are defined in this
section, the next chapter is going to use them for experimental studies.

     OIL, IPUS, IPVN, M2, NEER and VNI are taken logarithm (all data were taken to
logarithm will have L in pre name to identify), then the Dickey - Fuller unit root test for
time series (Dickey & Fuller, 1979) is tested for each of variables before incorporating
into VAR or SVAR model. Unit root test results find that LIPUS, LIPVN, CPI and
VNIBOR are stationary at level, while LOIL, LIBOR, LM2, LNEER, LER, and LVNI
are stationary at 1st difference (see table 15.1 in Appendix 15). Variables which are
stationary at level are retained as origin, while variables which are stationary at 1st
difference and at 2nd difference are taken the 1st and 2nd difference respectively (see
table 15.2 in Appendix 15). The data statistical descriptions after processing are
presented in table 4.2.

    The hypothesis H01 (VNIBOR has no Granger cause to DLER, DLNEER, and
DLVNI) has significance at only DLER and DLNEER, this means changes in VNIBOR
have cause on the changes in DLER and DLNEER. Meanwhile, the hypothesis H02
(DLER, DLNEER, and DLVNI respectively have no Granger cause to CPI) has not
significant in any case, thus DLER, DLNEER, and DLVNI don’t have cause changes
in CPI. From these results, we can see that bank lending channel and exchange rate
channel may exist in Vietnam, while asset price channel through stock market may not
exist. However, these transmission processes may be incomplete because market
interest rates, exchange rates, and stock index don’t have cause on changes in CPI.

    Finally, the Granger causality test is used for VNIBOR and CPI, and results show
that VNIBOR has Granger causality to CPI at 10% significance level (H03). This
demonstrates that monetary policy has impacted on price level but this impact can be
transmitted through other channels beyond the interest rate channel (via DLER),
exchange rate channel (via DLNEER), and asset price channel (DLVNI). In order to
                                           99


find more evidence for monetary policy transmission channels in Vietnam, VAR and
SVAR are recruited in next section.

       4.1.2. VAR model results

   VAR model is used to test the existence of three channels: the interest rate channel,
exchange rate channel, and the asset price channel, one by one.

   -   Interest rate channel

   VAR(5) for the interest rate channel there are two groups of variables: exogenous
variables including DLOIL, D2LIPUS, DLIBOR (which represent the external macro
shocks), and endogenous variables including LIPVN (demand shocks), VNIBOR
(monetary policy shocks), DLER (shocks in market interest rates, the interest rate
channel of monetary policy transmission), and variables which represent inflation
(CPI). Results for IRC with VAR model are presented in table 15.3 in Appendix 15, the
stability of model is checked by AR root test (see table 15.4 in Appendix 15), the optimal
lag is checked by lags criteria test (see table 15.5 in Appendix 15), and autocorrelation
phenomena is checked by LM test (see table 15.6 in Appendix 15) to determine the
consistency and efficiency of VAR.

   The AR root test shows that model has achieved stability standard, while Lag criteria
shows that lag 5 is suitable for VAR which define by LR, FPE, and AIC criteria.
Inspection of autocorrelation properties of model shows that model has no
autocorrelation anymore with lag 5; therefore VAR (5) is totally appropriate. The
impulse response function (IRF) is used to analyze the response of inflation to shocks.
IRF results in figure 3.1 show that inflation reacts in the same pattern with demand
shocks (LIPVN), monetary policy shocks (VNIBOR) and market interest rates shocks
(DLER).

   Thus, Vietnam inflation has a positive response to aggregate demand shocks that
means inflation was caused by aggregate demand shocks in the 2003 – 2012 periods.
Meanwhile, inflation reacts positively with Vietnams interbank offer rate and lending
rates of commercial banks, which defines the existence of a cost channel in Vietnam.
This result confirms the existence of IRC in Vietnam that also proves the hypothesis 1.
The Cost channel is seen as the puzzle in monetary policy transmission, when the central
bank tightens monetary policy by increasing policy rates, market interest rates increase
follow and then inflation increases instead of decreasing as theory. This phenomenon is
due to the dependence of enterprises on bank loans for their operations so that when
central bank tightens monetary policy, commercial banks increase their lending interest
rates, but enterprises can’t sell inventories quickly, they also can’t reduce their debt to
reduce input cost, the increase in lending rates leads to the increase in output price and
then increases overall price level. This result is quite differ to other results in studies in
developing countries such as in Thailand (Disyatat & Vongsinsirikul, 2003), in

many empirical studies, in which the interest rate channel is existed as stated theory.
This result confirms is the same as in some studies which defined the existence of cost
channel in monetary policy transmission.

   Empirical evidence on cost channels have been found in many studies. Barth III and
Ramey (2002) was the pioneering scientists in studying the impacts on the supply side
or the cost channel of monetary policy. According to Barth III and Ramey (2002), if
there are enterprises which depend on bank loans, a cost channel will be exist. In this
case, monetary policy tightening can’t even control inflation; it also leads to higher
inflation. Ravenna and Walsh (2006) confirmed that the existence of a cost channel will
greatly effect optimal monetary policy because any changes in monetary policy may
well cancel each other out. Many studies confirm the existence of cost channel such as
Tillmann (2008) in industrialized countries, Gaiotti and Secchi (2006) in manufacturing
industry in Italy, Adolfson et al. (2005) in euro zone, and Chowdhury et al. (2006) in
G7 countries.

   However, impacts of a cost channel on economic activities in different countries are
difference due to country characteristics (Allen & Gale, 2001, 2004). Cost channel
transmits monetary policy stronger in countries which have strong financial
intermediary regulations and poor competitions, whereas in countries such as the U.K.
and the U.S., financial markets are more competitive so that a cost channel is less
effective than an interest rate channel (Engert, 1999).

   -   Exchange rate channel

   VAR (5) is also used to test the existence of ERC, in which DLNEER variable is
replaced for DLER to proxy for exchange rate channel. The same verification steps as
in VAR for IRC are used for the exchange rate channel. Results are presented in table
15.7 in Appendix 15. AR root test result confirms the stability of VAR (5) for ERC as
all values are within the unit circle (see table 15.8 in Appendix 15), while lag 5 is
confirmed as the optimal lag for model by LR, FPE and AIC criteria (see table 15.9 in
Appendix 15), and LM test result also confirms that VAR(5) is no longer autocorrelation

(see table 15.10 in Appendix 15), thus this model is totally appropriate. Results of
impulse response function for ERC are presented in figure 4.2.

     Impulse response function results show no transmission of a monetary policy
through the exchange rate channel since inflation almost has no response to exchange
rate shocks. This result is fully consistent with the theory because USD/VND rate is
tightly controlled and intervened by SBV, thus ERC will be weak and almost non-
existent in Vietnam. This result confirms the hypothesis 2 that ERC may be weak or
almost not exist in Vietnam. This result is same as empirical evidences in developing
countries (Mishra, Montiel, Pedroni, & Spilimbergo, 2014; Mishra & Montiel, 2012;
Mishra et al., 2010).
                                          103


   Although, many empirical studies have found the existence of ERC in countries
around the world as Golinelli and Rovelli (2005) in the Czech Republic, Hungary and
Finland; Karasoy et al. (2005) in Turkey; Kierzenkowski (2005) in Finland; Faust and
Rogers (2003), H. Bjørnland and Halvorsen (2008), and H. C. Bjørnland (2009) in
Europe. However, there are some cases like Vietnam, such as Eritrea (Mengesha &
Holmes, 2013). Mengesha and Holmes (2013) discovered that IRC and ERC are
inactive, but ERC exists in the illegal foreign exchange market of Eritrea. Mishra and
Montiel (2012) found that most foreign exchange markets in developing countries are
intervened by central banks, and they also have poor links with international financial
markets, as well as the lack of debt and capital security markets so that ERC is weak or
non-existent.

   Some other studies proved the weakness of ERC in some countries. Clements et al.
(2001) detected a weak ERC in low-income European countries; Mugume (2011) also
found ERC is weak and ineffective in Uganda; Creel and Levasseur (2005) detected
there is no dominant channel in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland. While Vietnam
has the same characteristics of a developing country as Mishra and Montiel (2012)
mentioned so that the weak of ERC is easily clarified.

   -   Asset price channel

   Continue to use VAR(5) for APC, results are summarized in table 15.11 in Appendix
15. The AR root test shows that VAR(5) is stable (see table 15.12 in Appendix 15),
while the optimal lag test shows different results: LR and FPE criteria proposes lag 3,
AIC proposes lag 5, SC proposes lag 1, and HQ proposes lag 2 (see table 15.13 in
Appendix 15), in order to handle autocorrelation problem the lag 5 as proposed by AIC
is chosen. Then, the LM test confirms this choice (see table 15.14 in Appendix 15). The
results of impulse response function for asset price channel are shown in figure 4.3.

   As stated in chapter 2, APC includes two main channels: Tobin'q theory and wealth
effect, both mechanisms transmit monetary policy through impacts of asset prices on
firm investment and private consumption. However, the existence of APC requires a
highly developed financial market with a deep engagement of enterprises and investors.
                                                                                    104


APC exists in almost all developed economies, but only a few developing countries
have APC. Mishra and Montiel (2012) found that most developing countries which
have a lack of debt and equity markets, thus APC is limited.

     Meanwhile, Vietnam has just developed their stock market in 2000, it is also small
and has a lack of valuable products as well as the participation of enterprises and
investors so that the weak of APC is sensible (see table 4.4).

   Besides that, Vietnamese investors usually look at macroeconomic factors including
interest rates, exchange rates, and inflation to analyze and make investment decisions,
so that both interest rates and inflation seemly impact stronger on the stock market. To
test this hypothesis, Granger causality test is used for stock index with policy rate,
exchange rate, and inflation.

   Grangers test results show that CPI has an effect of DLVNI. In fact, investors require
higher rate of return for higher inflation, so the stock price will fall when inflation
increases, thus CPI and VNI will have a negative relationship. The stable inflation in
2003 – 2007 period (less than 10% per year) has increased VNIndex and vice versa in
the 2008 – 2011 period (see figure 13.14 in Appendix 13). Thus, APC via stock price
may not exist in Vietnam due to a low-developed stock market, while other financial
intermediaries including commercial banks thrive and play an important role in capital
markets. This result confirms the hypothesis 3 that APC is weak or not exist in Vietnam.
This result is also confirmed in studies about monetary policy transmission in
developing countries such as in Indonesia (Afandi, 2005a), in Uganda (Mugume, 2011),
in Brazil (André Minella & Souza-Sobrinho, 2013) and many other developing
countries (Mishra et al., 2014; Mishra & Montiel, 2012; Mishra et al., 2010).

   As we know, APC transmits monetary policy not only through stock price, but also
through other asset prices such as real estate. Since people spend between 3 to 5% of
their income for housing therefore changes in real estate prices have a huge impact on
the economy (Maki & Palumbo, 2001), thus real estate can transmit monetary policy
socks. H. C. Bjørnland and Jacobsen (2010) studied the case of Norway, Sweden, and
                                           106


United Kingdom showed that housing price reacts immediately and strongly to changes
in interest rates, while a decrease in housing prices reduced inflation and GDP.

   According to Bernanke and Gertler (1989), housing prices may become the cause of
changes in macroeconomic factors and inflation targeting policy as asset prices not only
represent the value of assets, real estate also serves as a storage medium so real estate
prices react very quickly to changes in macroeconomic elements such as interest rates
(Bernanke & Kuttner, 2005; Rigobon & Sack, 2004; Zettelmeyer, 2004). Case et al.
(2005) found that people’s wealth is more important than stock market value in many
countries thus the increase in housing price could affect housing activities through
Tobin's q theory. Elbourne (2008) found similar evidence in the United Kingdom and
suggested that the transmission of monetary policy can be indirect and direct through
housing prices: the direct channel is through effects of income and cash flows, while
the indirect channel influence is the wealth effects and commercial bank credit channel.

   In Vietnam, real estate is an important investment channel and important storage
property of people, so monetary policy may transmit through the real estate price.
However, because of data limitation on the prices and volume of real estate transactions
in Vietnam, this study can’t investigate this channel.

   Summary, the evidence of cost channel is found through VAR model, while ERC
and APC are weak. In the next section, SVAR model is used to study all three channels
in one system to retest the existence and assess the intensity of each channel.

       4.1.3. SVAR model results

   SVAR results show that CPI is affected by oil prices (DLOIL), policy rate
(VNIBOR), exchange rate (DLNEER), and market interest rate (DLER) (see table 16.1
in Appendix 16), which may indicate the existence of IRC and ERC in Vietnam. The
stability of SVAR is confirmed by AR root test result (see table 16.2 in Appendix 16),
the optimal lag is proposed by SC and HQ is lag 1, while FPE and AIC propose lag 2,
LR proposes lag 3 (see table 16.3 in Appendix 16). In this case, lag 5 is chosen for
SVAR due to monthly data characteristics. LM test reconfirms this selection, LM test
result confirms lag 5 is a perfect fit (see table 16.4 in Appendix 16).
                                                                                        107


   Results of impulse response functions and variance decomposition are shown in
figure 4.4. IRF results found that inflation has a strong response to oil prices (DLOIL),
policy rates (VNIBOR), money supply (DLM2), market interest rates (DLER), and
stock prices (DLVNI).

   In fact, oil is an important input of the economy, while Vietnam is particularly a
crude oil exporter and a petroleum product importer, thus the oil price shocks have had
a great effect on input costs on the private sector.

   While responses of inflation to policy rate, money supply, and market interest rates
reconfirm the existence of a cost channel in Vietnam the same as the results from
                                           108


previous VAR models. However, IRF results of SVAR found that inflation just
responses to market interest rate shocks after 3 months, and monetary policy
transmission through interest rate channel tend to last longer than a year and do not stop
after 12 months. This means that IRC transmits monetary policy is not only for the
short-term but also for the long-term.

   SVAR also found the same interesting results of a weak ERC and APC in Vietnam.
To clarify the contribution of the shocks to the variance of inflation, variance
decomposition results are calculated in table 4.6.

   The variance decomposition results show that oil price shocks explain over 83% to
the variance of CPI’s forecast after 5 months and over 93% after a year. Meanwhile,
industrial production shocks only explain the variance of CPI’s forecast in the short
term and almost loses impact after 3 months.

        4.1.4. Robustness check

   In order to check the robustness of the models, M2 of Vietnam is collected to replace
VNIBOR in proxy for Vietnam’s monetary policy; IRC, ERC, and APC are tested by
                                                            109


VAR model one by one. All procedures and tests for VAR are done as previous work
(see Appendix 17). Firstly, Grangers causality tests define that money supply (M2)
almost has no Granger causality on lending rate and exchange rate, while it has a
relationship with the stock market with 10% significant level (see table 17.1 in
Appendix 17).

Interest rate channel with M2 (see tables from 17.2 to 17.5 in Appendix 17)

     The impulse response function of VAR with DLM2 for IRC shows that the lending
rate does not respond to money supply in a consistent pattern (figure 4.5).

     Meanwhile, inflation does not respond to money supply at all; it means that through
a money supply variable, we don’t see the evidence of IRC in Vietnam. Meanwhile, the
strong positive response of CPI to DLER (lending rate of commercial banks) indicates
that inflation responses to lending rate of banking system through the effects of other
factors of monetary policy. This result also confirms that policy rate is more effective
                                                             110


in monetary policy conducting in comparing with money supply of SBV because the
money supply hasn’t affected the lending rates of commercial banks.



Exchange rate channel with M2 (see tables from 17.6 to 17.9 in Appendix 17)
     The same results are found for ERC as VAR with interest rate in the previous
section: ERC is weak in Vietnam. The IRF of VAR for ERC shows that CPI doesn’t
respond to DLM2, while CPI responses weakly to DLNEER, this means that Vietnam’s
inflation doesn’t respond to monetary policy through an exchange rate with a money
supply, or Vietnam’s monetary policy doesn’t transmit through an exchange rate with
inflation. The result also suggest that policy rate is more effective than money supply
in Vietnam.

     The same results like IRC and ERC were found, VAR model doesn’t find the
evidence of APC when we use money supply to proxy for monetary policy. VNindex
doesn’t respond to money supply shocks, while CPI also doesn’t respond to money
supply shocks; it means monetary policy doesn’t transmit through stock prices with
inflation if we use money supply to proxy. Meanwhile, stock price responds stronger to
inflation shocks, it means that investors look at inflation to make their investments.
These results are same with VAR in previous section.

     Results of VAR models for IRC, ERC and APC with money supply suggest that
money supply is not a good proxy for Vietnam monetary policy; it means monetary
policy doesn’t transmit effectively through money supply to economic variables then to
inflation. In fact, SBV has focused on policy rates in monetary policy conducing, while
SBV didn’t control money supply in 2000 – 2012 period effectively, and they usually
                                                                                      112


violated targets of money supply in monetary policy conducting so that money supply
is not good proxy (see table 13.2 and table 13.4 in Appendix 13).

         So, this study does more robustness tests with other proxies for Vietnam monetary
policy including rediscount rate (RDR) and refinance rate (RFR) in SVAR model. Both
RDR and RFR are stationary at level 1 so that they are taken the 1st difference (they
became DRDR and DRFR) (see table 15.1 and 15.2 in Appendix 15). Granger causality
tests show that both RDR and RFR have Granger causality on lending rate and exchange
rate, but they don’t have with stock index (see tables from 17.1 in Appendix 17).

         SVAR with DRDR (see tables from 18.1 to 18.4 in Appendix 18).

   Impulse response function shows that CPI has a strong positive responses to DRDR,
DLER so that IRC exists. The positive responses of CPI to policy rate and lending rate
indicate that a cost channel is exists as previous results in VAR and SVAR models.
Meanwhile, CPI seemly doesn’t respond to exchange rate so that the evidence of ERC
is not found. In Grangers causality test, DRDR doesn’t have granger cause to VNindex,
while CPI has negative response to VNindex shocks; it means that the relationship
between CPI and VNindex in SVAR model with RDR doesn’t reflect the transmission
of shocks from RDR to VNIndex then to CPI, which means Vietnam’s monetary policy
doesn’t transmit through APC.
   As explained in the previous section, investors in Vietnam also look at inflation with
other economic factors to make their investment decisions so that the relationship
between stock index and inflation reflects the effect of inflation on stock market. In
order to see more detail on Vietnam’s monetary policy transmission, variance
decomposition of SVAR with RDRD is calculated, results in table 4.7 shows that
rediscount rate explains high fluctuations in variance of CPI in comparing with SVAR
for VNIBOR.

   Meanwhile, money supply (M2), commodity price shocks (OIL), and exchange rate
shocks (NEER) don’t have important positions in variance composition of CPI.
Continue with refinance rate, SVAR is estimated.



   SVAR with DRFR (see tables from 18.5 to 18.8 in Appendix 18).

   The robustness test is continued with a new proxy for Vietnam monetary policy:
refinance rate (RFR). Results show the same idea with the rediscount rate because SBV
has changed both RDR and RFR have the same pattern.

   IRF results show that inflation responds strongly with positive sign to refinance rate,
lending rate, it means cost channel exists in Vietnam. While, inflation doesn’t respond
                                                 115


to exchange rate and money supply, it means ERC doesn’t exist while money supply
isn’t effective in Vietnam. And the relationship between inflation and stock index is the
same as SVAR with RDR. The variance decomposition of SVAR with RFR is the same
as in SVAR with RDR. Variance of inflation is explained much by shocks in the
refinance rate.

   So, monetary policy transmission through channels existed in Vietnam in 2003 –
2012 period. VAR and SVAR models found the same evidence of cost channel which
increase inflation when central bank tightens monetary policy. Vietnam doesn’t have a
highly-developed financial market, while enterprises depend on bank loans so that they
are difficult funds to replace by banks and they have to accept higher lending rates
when central bank increases policy rate, the increase input capital cost puts pressure on
output price thus enterprises have to increase their product prices respectively, this
creates a cost channel as in many other studies that prove the existence of a cost channel
(Adolfson et al., 2005; Barth III & Ramey, 2002; Chowdhury et al., 2006; Gaiotti &
Secchi, 2006; Ravenna & Walsh, 2006).

   Results from VAR and SVAR models have found no evidences of ERC and APC in
Vietnam. The combination of the existence conditions of bank lending channel in
                                             116


chapter 1 with Vietnam’s economic conditions in chapter 2 such as financial market
development, banking system characteristics and the results of chapter 3 suggest that
the bank lending channel may be a strong channel in Vietnam.

   In fact, in a small-open economy with a highly developed banking system, low
developed stock market, while enterprises, individuals, and households are depended
on bank loans, a bank lending channel will become an important channel. Next section
presents the results of bank lending channel testing.

4.2.   Bank lending channel in Vietnam
       4.2.1. Data

   Due to difficulties in entangling demand and supply factors in measuring the effects
of bank characteristics on bank credit supply by using aggregate data, certain
characteristics of banks including size, liquidity, and owner equity are assumed having
effects on their credit supply. In addition, loan demand is assumed largely independent
with bank characteristics and mostly dependent on macroeconomic factors. The model
in Altunbas, Gambacorta, and Marques-Ibanez (2010a) as presented in chapter 3 is
applied to investigate impacts of bank risk and characteristics on bank lending channel.
   We used a unique dataset of bank balance sheet items and macroeconomic variables
for Vietnam over the period from 2003 to 2012. Our data was collected from different
sources, bank characteristics data are hand collected from financial reports and annual
reports, other data are from Vietnam Bureau of Statistics and IMF. Due to the
availability of bank specific data, we use an unbalanced panel data set. The following
table describes variables in our analysis.

      First of all, we estimate the transmission of monetary policy through bank lending
channel in the separately variable including bank size, bank capital, bank liquidity and
bank risk, then we estimate the whole system with all these bank characteristics in one
model, results of estimation are summarized in table 4.12 and 4.13. Models have been
estimated using the GMM estimator suggested by Arellano and Bond (1991b), Arellano
and Bover (1995a), and extended by Blundell and Bond (1997, 1998). This technique
has an advantage for addressing the S. J. Nickell (1981) bias associated with the fixed
effects in short panels (e.g., bias due to the presence of the lagged dependent variable
and bias due to the endogeneity of other explanatory variables) which ensures efficiency
and consistency, provided the models are not subject to serial correlation of order two
and the instruments that are used are valid (when assessed using the Sargan test).

   The positive effects of bank size on bank lending suggested that Vietnamese banks
are more affected by the adverse implication of informational frictions. This is not
consistent with M. Ehrmann (2004); Ehrmann, Gambacorta, Martinez‐Pagés, and
Worms (2003), but consist with the results for the U.S. in many studies. This might be
due to the fact that Vietnamese banks are supported by the government from failure and
larger banks are usually stated own banks that have more advantages than other banks
for government support thus larger banks supply more credit than small banks. In
addition, the result implies the fact that large banks in Vietnam are more prone to
increase credit without considering risks.
   The positive effects of bank capital and bank liquidity on bank lending are consistent
with results of many studies in bank lending channel. This is explained that commercial
banks with higher capital or higher liquidity asset will be more flexible in provide loans
for the economy since they are less restriction to capital or liquidity barriers.
   Liquidity has a positive impact on bank credit to the businesses and this suggests
that liquid banks are well equipped to increase the loan portfolio when there is a change
in the monetary policy. This reflects the fact that during the period of analysis,
Vietnamese banks are having problems with liquidity and liquid banks are less
controlled by the government in providing credit. Therefore, liquidity is a very
important factor in the supply of credit to firms and households in Vietnams market.
This result is also supported by the liquidity focused policies of Vietnam government
on controlling of commercial banks that favor credit growth of more liquid banks and
limit the growth of illiquid banks.
   The riskiness of the credit portfolio has a positive effect on the bank’s capacity to
provide lending. This result is contrary to Altunbas et al. (2010a) Theoretically, other
factors being equal, higher provision for loan loss reduces bank’s profit and bank capital
and therefore, banks should provide less lending supply. However, Vietnamese banks
seem to cover the reduction in profit by increasing credit supply and this is a serious
problem which undermines the soundness of the banking system. This result confirms
the suggestion from the literature that banks’ risk condition matter for the supply of
loan. In this regard, there is evidence that Vietnamese banks’ debts are sensible to bank
                                           119


risk. More importantly, this sensitivity seems to increase as bank becomes riskier. This
finding implies a very imprudent lending practice of Vietnamese commercial banks
during the analyzed time period and results in a very high non-performing loan rate at
the current time.
   The results of the regression analysis indicates that Vietnamese banks are strongly
affected by monetary policy shocks in the current and previous year. We find that the
increase in interest rate in both last year and current significantly reduced bank lending.
While, the lag variable of the logarithm of loans have negative effects on current bank
lending, this suggests that the outstanding loans of Vietnamese commercial banks are
converging together. Meanwhile, the lag variable of logarithm of GDP has positive
effects on bank lending suggests that the growth in output has significant effects on
bank lending through the increase in credit demand.
   But, in order to examine the existence of a bank lending channel, we have to examine
the interactions term between policy rate and bank characteristics that reflect the effects
on monetary policy on credit supply of commercial banks. All interaction terms between
policy rate and bank size, bank capital and bank risk have significant effects on bank
lending which indicates the existence of bank lending channel in Vietnam. These results
confirm the hypothesis 4 of this study. These results also are same as many empirical
studies in many countries including developed and developing countries about the
existence of BLC but they have some little difference on the bank characteristics which
impact on BLC.
   The interaction terms between size and monetary policy have positive signs, it is
consistent with literature on BLC, and large banks have the ability to supply more credit
when central bank tightens monetary policy. While the interaction terms between bank
capital and monetary policy have insignificant negative signs, that is in contrary with
the literature on bank lending channel, well capitalized Vietnamese banks are not be
able to better buffer their lending activities against shocks. So this must be tested in
more model to get conclusion.
   The interaction terms between liquidity proxy and monetary policy are positive. This
is very interesting to state that Vietnamese commercial banks with liquid asset structure
                                                120


are better equipped to cope well with monetary policy shocks. However, the interaction
terms between loan loss provision and monetary policy have predicted positive sign,
indicating that high risk banks in Vietnam are more motivated in supply more credit to
offset the decrease in profit that is caused by the increase in loan loss provision.
      In order to examine the bank lending channel, we should put all determinants into
one model which is presented in table 4.11.

      The results are consistent with all above findings with these results means that a
bank lending channel exists in Vietnam, and especially Vietnamese commercial banks
have risk-taking action in responding with monetary policy. But as the study of Nguyen
and Boateng (2013), then Nguyen and Boateng (2015a) and Nguyen and Boateng

(2015b) suggest that when we use commercial bank characteristics to investigate the
bank lending channel we will face to problem of data normalization due to the
heteroskedasticity between commercial banks thus we should standardize commercial
bank data to be more reliable measurement of bank characteristics. Thus, this study
standardizes the data of commercial bank characteristics by counting the mean of each
characteristics including bank size, bank capital, bank liquidity and bank loan loss
provision for each bank, then we minus the value of each characteristic for its mean one
by one for each bank. After that we re-estimate the GMM model with the same
modification. The results are presented in table 4.12 and 4.13.

      With the effects of each characteristic of commercial bank on bank lending in table
4.12, we find that all findings in previous section are same and consistent exclude the
effects of bank capital. The positive effects of bank size, bank capital, bank liquidity
                                           122


and bank risk determine that the larger bank, the higher capitalized bank, the better
liquidity bank and the riskier bank will expand their loans higher. Meanwhile, the
interaction terms between bank size, bank capital, bank liquidity and bank risk with the
policy rate confirm the previous findings which means that the bank lending channel is
existed in Vietnam. Firstly, the significant positive interaction term between bank size
and policy rate means that the larger bank increases their loans higher in comparing
with the smaller bank when the central bank implements the contractionary monetary
policy rate that is consistence with the theory and previous evidences. In addition, the
significant positive interaction term between bank liquidity and policy rate also
confirms that the better liquid banks are more flexible in increasing their loans when
the central bank increases the policy rate that also consistence with theory and empirical
evidences. Besides that the significant positive interaction term between bank risk and
policy rate defines the risk – taking actions of Vietnamese banks as argued in previous
section in which the riskier banks increase their loan higher when central bank
implements contractionary monetary policy to absorb their risk that create the hazard
moral and higher risk for Vietnamese banking system. Table 4.13 presents estimation
results when we put all variables into one model, these results are interesting.

          These results also confirm the consistent of our findings, this also indicates the
significant effects of bank capital on bank lending when Vietnamese commercial banks
respond to monetary policy rate. It means that the evidence of the bank lending channel
in Vietnam is strong, and Vietnamese monetary policy effects on bank credit supply
through the bank lending channel with the interactions with bank size and bank capital.
These results confirm the hypothesis 5. As presented in chapter 1, State bank of Vietnam
uses VNIBOR, refinance rate (RFR) and rediscount rate (RDR) to conduct monetary
policy, in this section we use VNIBOR to proxy for policy rate which presents for
monetary policy. The next section uses refinance rate and rediscount rate to proxy for
policy rate with the aim at testing the consistent in this section.

          4.2.3. Robustness test

       Firstly, rediscount rate (RFR) is used to replace for VNIBOR in proxy for
Vietnamese monetary policy, but all the bank characteristics are measured by
standardized way as we presented in previous section due to better results in GMM. The
GMM results with RFR are presented in table 4.14 and table 4.15.

     Estimation results from GMM with RDR indicate the same evidence as in GMM
with VNIBOR in all aspects. Continue with the GMM model, this study replaces
VNIBOR by rediscount rate (RDR). Estimation results are presented in table 4.16 and
4.17. Results show the same evidences as in the GMM model with RFR and VNIBOR.
So that, we can confirm the consistency of our findings in this section.

     Thus, the evidences of a bank lending channel are confirmed with strong consistent
in estimators. In the next section, this study goes into investigating the impact of the
2008 global financial crisis on the bank lending channel in Vietnam.

           4.2.4. The effects of the crisis on the bank lending channel in Vietnam

     In fact, the 2008 global financial crisis had a strong impact on economies around
the world, it also had an impact on monetary policy transmissions and bank lending
channels (Andrieş & Stoica, 2014; Aristei & Gallo, 2014; Bernanke, 1983; Carmassi,
Gros, & Micossi, 2009; Cassola, Hortacsu, & Kastl, 2009; Gambacorta & Marques‐
Ibanez, 2011; Kalemli-Ozcan, Papaioannou, & Perri, 2013; Mishkin, 2011; Olmo &
Sanso-Navarro, 2015; Pronobis, 2014; Schich, 2008; Soedarmono, Machrouh, &
Tarazi, 2013; Taylor, 2009). Vietnam is a small open emerging market, which was
                                                       127


strongly impacted by this crisis so we need to investigate the effects of the 2008 global
financial crisis on the bank lending channel in Vietnam.

   In order to investigate the effects of the 2008 global financial crisis on the bank
lending channel in Vietnam, we can divide the data into two sub-periods including pre-
crisis and post-crisis periods, but due to the lack of data this study does not use this
method. Instead, we use the proxy for the 2008 global financial crisis, this is VIX (the
implied volatility of S&P 500 options contracts) that is suggested to be used to
investigate the impacts of the crisis (Druck, Magud, & Mariscal, 2015). Vix measures
the implied volatility in S&P 500 option contracts which will increase in a crisis and
decrease in stable times. We collect Vix from Yahoo finance and draw the figure 4.11,
it reflects that in the 2008 – 2011 period when the crisis was severe Vix increased, and
in stable period from 2003 to 2007 Vix was lower.

   By using the VIX value, we add VIX as an independent variable and the interaction
variable between VIX, policy rates and bank characteristics including bank size, bank
capital, bank liquidity and bank risk to investigate the impacts of the 2008 global
financial crisis on the bank lending channel in Vietnam.

   The system GMM models are used with VNIBOR, RDR and RFR respectively in
proxying for Vietnamese monetary policy to investigate the impacts of the 2008 global

financial crisis on the bank lending channel in Vietnam. The results of the estimations
are presented in table 4.18.

      The results show the same evidence as previous estimations in section 4.2.1 and
4.2.2 for the same variables. While the significant positive effects of VIX on bank
lending indicate that Vietnamese commercial banks expand their lending in crisis
periods, that means the bank lending channel is stronger in crisis periods. Meanwhile,
the interaction terms between policy rate, bank size, bank capital and VIX have
significant positive effects on bank lending of the Vietnamese commercial banks and
indicate that the bank lending channel is stronger in larger banks and higher capitalized
bank in crisis. These results confirm the hypothesis 6.

     These results are consistent and make sense in Vietnam. In Vietnam, the banking
system is faced with risks especially credit risks in a crisis period that is why SBV has
released many policies to restrict commercial banks expanding their lending which
restricts small banks and low capitalized banks in supplying crisis in this periods.

     Thus, through the results of the GMM models and the robustness tests we can
conclude that: the bank lending channel exists in Vietnam, and in which the bank size
and bank capital have a significant positive effect on bank responses to monetary policy.
Although the lack of strong significant statistical evidence, the liquidity and risk of
commercial banks have positive effects on the bank lending channel, especially with
the positive effects of bank risk that indicate the risk-taking action of Vietnamese
commercial banks in responding to monetary policy which pose more challenges for
Vietnamese authorities and monetary policy makers in policy conducting. Therefore,
the next chapter summarizes and gets conclusions with some policy implications for
Vietnam.

            CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS

5.1.   Introduction

   This concluding chapter summarizes the empirical findings of this thesis.
Specifically, section 5.2 that recapitulates the three research questions, empirical
methodology for their testing and the results. These discussions also link to those in
previous chapters. Then Section 5.3 delineates the major contributions of this research.
This is followed by a discussion on the policy implications of this research both for the
bank managers and their regulators in section 5.4. Section 5.5 pinpoints to some
limitations of this research and some suggestions for future research.



5.2.   Review of research questions, methodology and findings

   Monetary policy and monetary policy transmission always are exciting fields in
theory and empirical studies. Theory and empirical evidence state that monetary policy
is an important macroeconomic policy which impacts on widespread economic
variables such as exchange rate, interest rate, and asset price to aim at inflation, output,
and employment. In which, price stability or inflation stability is the most important
target of monetary policy that central banks aim to achieve in both short-run and long-
run. But, the central bank can’t achieve all targets at one time in reality, they have to
accept some trade-offs between targets such as trade-off between inflation and
unemployment which is mentioned in Phillip curve. Besides that central banks also face
too many dilemmas in monetary policy conducting such as the ineffectiveness of
monetary policy in deflation or liquidity trap environment, this has motivated
innovations in monetary policy conducting such as quantitative easing program and
inflation targeting policy. While the effectiveness of quantitative easing program is
argued, the inflation targeting policy is a new trend around the world in the recent
decade.
                                          131


   Central bank mainly uses three tools to conduct monetary policy including policy
rate, open market operation, and reserve requirement. In which, policy rate and open
market operation is used more frequently nowadays so that policy rate or money supply
is two of the best monetary policy proxies. In order to conduct monetary policy, central
bank changes one monetary policy tool or many tools at one time. From the changes in
the monetary policy tools, monetary policy transmits shocks to intermediate targets such
as money supply (M1, M2, and M3), market interest rates to effect on economic
variables, this is the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Monetary policy
transmits through many economic variables to head to inflation and output; this is
explained in basis through IS-LM model. In which, monetary policy transmits through
interest rate channel, exchange rate channel, asset price channel, credit channel, and
expectation channel.

   Interest rate channel transmits monetary policy shocks through interest rate to
investment decisions. It is a traditional channel of monetary policy; it is strong at
countries that have a highly developed financial markets such as in the U.S. or G7
countries. Exchange rate channel is another important channel of monetary policy in
open economies. If a country closes their economy, exchange rate channel will be weak
or not exist at all. Exchange rate channel transmits monetary policy through exchange
rates to trade activities and investment flow. Exchange rate channel is affected by the
openness level of the economy and it may be affected by the level of external debts of
economy. Asset price channel is also an important channel of monetary policy; it
transmits monetary policy through the wealth effect and Tobin’s q theory. In overall,
asset price channel transmits monetary policy shocks through asset prices to investment
decisions of enterprises and consumption decisions of households and individuals.
Asset price channel is affected by the development of financial markets, especial the
stock markets and other asset markets. Asset price channel mainly exist in developed
countries with a highly developed financial market such as in the U.S., U.K. through
stock, bond and even through real estate prices. Credit channel is another side of
monetary policy transmission. It transmits monetary policy through credit market to
credit supply side (bank lending channel), or credit demand side (balance sheet channel,
                                           132


cash flow channel, unexpected price level channel, and household effects liquidity). In
which, the bank lending channel and the balance sheet channel are two of the most
important sub-channels of the credit channel. Credit channel exists in almost all
countries in the world, but it is more important in countries that have a highly-developed
banking system in combination with low-developed stock markets, while enterprises in
these countries depend on bank loans for operation. These countries are usually
developing countries such as Vietnam. Expectation channel is a channel of monetary
policy, but it is difficult to stand separately from others. Expectation channel enhances
the effects of other channels through the expectation of economic participants in
monetary policy. It depends on the independence, transparency, reliability of central
bank in monetary policy conducting and other policies.

   More detail, bank lending channel is one of the important channels in credit channel.
Bank lending channel transmits monetary policy shocks to the ability of the banking
system in granting credit. The changes the monetary policy effect on credit supply of
commercial banks, which then effect on investment and consumption. Bank lending
channel needs some conditions for existence

   -   Commercial banks cannot replace funds from deposits.
   -   Enterprises and individuals depend on credit from commercial banks for
       investment and consumption
   -   And central bank can effect on credit supply of commercial banks.

   Bank lending channel is affected by both macroeconomic factors and
microeconomic factors. Bank lending channel is affected by macroeconomic factors
such as economic structure, economic crisis, and economic structure changes which are
depended on economic characteristics each country. It also is affected by the
competition in the banking sector which can be measured by CR5 or HHI indicator. It
is affected by microeconomic factors including bank characteristics such as bank size,
bank capital, bank liquidity, bank risk, and bank customer. The evidence of bank
lending channel is found in many studies at many countries with many levels. A country
that has low-developed financial markets, big banking system, and strong intervention
                                          133


of government into foreign exchange market, and many small and medium enterprises
that rely heavily on bank loans such as Vietnam will have a strong bank lending channel.

   Besides learning about a bank lending channel, previous studies also try to
investigate the effects of many factors on bank lending channel. In the light of a study
about monetary policy transmission and bank lending channel, economists also try to
investigate the effects of crisis on bank lending channel and other channels. In Vietnam,
there are only a few comprehensive studies about monetary policy transmission and
especially bank lending channel so that monetary policy transmission and bank lending
channel are good research gaps to study in Vietnam.

   This thesis goes to investigate the monetary policy transmission and bank lending
channel in Vietnam with two questions:

       Question 1: Do interest rate channel, exchange rate channel and asset price
       channel exist in Vietnam?
       Question 2: Does bank lending channel exist in Vietnam? And do bank size, bank
       capital, bank liquidity and bank risk effect and the 2008 global financial crisis
       have an effect on the bank lending channel in Vietnam?

   The following three sub-sections (5.2.1 and 5.2.2) summarizes the methodology,
and major findings relating to each of these research questions.

       5.2.1. Research question 1: “Does an interest rate channel, exchange rate
channel and asset price channel exist in Vietnam?”

   The research question 1 was addressed by the literature review in chapter 2 in section
2.2 (monetary policy transmission) that clarified there are some main transmission
channels of monetary policy including an interest rate channel, exchange rate channel,
asset price channel, credit channel and expectation channel. This section also defined
that all these channels may exist in Vietnam and in developing economies, but due to
the under-developed financial markets while the banking system dominates the capital
market, Vietnamese government usually intervenes with the foreign exchange market
to control exchange rate, stock market that had just launched on 2000 thus there are no
                                           134


evidences of exchange rate channel and asset price channel are found, that mean they
may be weak and non-existence.

   Therefore, section 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, especially sub-section 3.3.2 has investigated suitable
models for testing the existence of an interest rate channel, exchange rate channel and
asset price channel in monetary policy transmission. Monetary policy is best proxies by
policy rates or money supply, but policy rates are preferred nowadays. There are many
econometric models which can be used to test monetary policy transmission and bank
lending channels such as VAR and related models (SVAR, FAVAR), or the
cointergrated models such as ECM, VECM, and ARDL, or DSGE and GMM. As a
result, VAR and SVAR are the two most suitable models in testing these channels
through time-series data, thus they are recruited to test the existence of an interest rate
channel, exchange rate channel and asset price channel in Vietnam from 2003 to 2012.
The detail modification and variables which used in VAR and SVAR models are
presented in sub-sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.4 of chapter 3. In which, VAR models are firstly
used to test the existence of each channel, then SVAR model is used to test three
channels in one system that have more advantages in a theoretical and statistical
manner.

   Results of VAR and SVAR models in section 4.2 of chapter 4 indicated the first
main findings of this thesis: the cost channel existed in Vietnam, while they can not find
the evidences of the exchange rate channel and asset price channel that means they may
be weak or non-existent in Vietnam. The evidence of cost channel puts Vietnamese
policy makers into a tough dilemma situation as monetary policy is not effective in
controlling inflation.

   These results are consistent with the theory and reality situation in Vietnam. In a
developing country that has a low-developed stock market, while government
intervenes strongly into the foreign exchange market such as in Vietnam, the exchange
rate channel and asset price channel may be weak or nonexistent. We have already seen
these characteristics in Vietnams economy in section 1.1 of chapter 1 when we analysis
macroeconomic factors and monetary policy. Besides that SBV expanded monetary
                                         135


policy in 2003 – 2007 periods, and then they changed frequently in 2008 – 2012 period
from expansion to tightening in 2003 – 2012 periods. The expansionary monetary policy
in 2003 – 2007 period has created an inflation risk and instability risk for Vietnam’s
economy, while quick changes in the monetary policy in 2008 – 2012 period created
the instability in macroeconomic, financial system, banking system, stock market, and
foreign exchange market that combines with effects of the 2008 global financial crisis
have led Vietnam’s economy into high danger. The inflation in Vietnam has increased
year by year and boomed in 2008 – 2011 period, which caused many bad consequences.

   The existence of a cost channel in Vietnam is also consistent with this theory. In
Vietnam, small and medium enterprises are a big part of the economy; they depend
heavily on bank loans. When SBV tightens monetary policy, interest rate increases,
commercial banks increase the lending rate or cut credit supply, the increase in the
lending rate of commercial banks increases input cost of enterprises, thus enterprises
increase their output price respectively. Besides that these results also motivate this
thesis on testing the bank lending channel in Vietnam.

   The sub-section 4.1.4 of chapter 4 also tested the robustness of VAR and SVAR
results by using money supply (M2) in replace of VNIBOR to proxy for monetary
policy. VAR and SVAR results with money supply do not show good evidence.
Although, a cost channel is found in Vietnam, and evidence of an exchange rate channel
and asset price channel are not found. It means that policy rate is more effective in
monetary policy conducting in Vietnam, thus this results are helpful in making
implications for Vietnamese policy makers.

      5.2.2. Research question 2: Does a bank lending channel exist in Vietnam?
And does bank size, bank capital, bank liquidity and bank risk have an effect and the
2008 global financial crisis effect on bank lending channel in Vietnam?

   The dependence of enterprises in Vietnam’s banking system and the dominance of
commercial banks in financial markets, while stock market has just developed in 2000
are goods conditions for the existence of a bank lending channel.
                                          136


   In order to test the existence and the determinants which include bank characteristics
and the 2008 global financial crisis on the bank lending channel in Vietnam. The section
2.3 has summarized the transmission mechanism, the existing conditions and the
determinants of bank lending channel, especially in a developing country like Vietnam
which has all conditions for its existence. Then sub-channel 3.2.4 and 3.3.3 in chapter
3 presented the model that used to test the existence and determinants of bank lending
channel in Vietnam. While the sub-section 3.3.4 presented the research data that is used
for testing bank the lending channel through the GMM model.

   By using the GMM model, the results in section 4.2 of chapter 4 with panel data
from 30 Vietnamese commercial banks in 2003 – 2012 periods have some main
findings.

   Firstly, the loan level of Vietnamese commercial banks is converged which means
that small Vietnamese commercial banks grow their credit portfolio to the level of large
banks which will increase the competition in banking system. But this may create the
over-supply action of small banks that may create a risk for the banking system.

   Secondly, the monetary policy has a strong effect on bank lending in Vietnam
including the current effects and lag effects on the following year, this means that the
monetary policy transmits through the credit channel in Vietnam. While, the strong
positive effects of the economic growth on bank lending indicates the strong effects on
credit demand on bank lending in Vietnam.

   Thirdly, the main findings and the main aim of this study is to examine the existence
of a bank lending channel. All results in section 4.2 of chapter 4 solve this question.
The results indicate the existing evidence of a bank lending channel in Vietnam.

   Fourthly, the results in section 4.2 of chapter 4 also define the determinants of the
bank lending channel in Vietnam.

   Bank size has a significant positive effect on bank lending of Vietnamese
commercial banks. The results also imply the fact that larger banks in Vietnam are more
prone to increase credit without considering risks, they also have the ability to supply
                                           137


more credit when central bank tightens monetary policy. Meanwhile, Vietnamese banks
are supported by the government from failure that creates a moral hazard risk in
Vietnams banking system.

   The bank capital also has a significant positive effect on bank lending in responding
to monetary policy. Which means that higher capital banks will be more flexible in
responding to monetary policy.

   Liquid banks are well equipped to increase the loan portfolio when there is a change
in the monetary policy so that liquidity is a very important factor in the supply of credit
to enterprises and households in Vietnam market. Furthermore, Vietnamese commercial
banks with a liquid asset structure are better equipped to cope well with shocks of
monetary policy, except in a post crisis period.

   The riskiness of a credit portfolio has a positive effect on the bank’s capacity to
provide lending, it means that Vietnamese banks seem to cover the reduction in profit
by increasing credit supply and this is a serious problem which undermines the
soundness of the banking system. And high risk banks in Vietnam are more motivated
in supplying more credit to offset the decrease in profit that is caused by the increase in
loan loss provision that is known as risk-taking action of commercial banks.

   Fifthly, in order to investigate the effects of the 2008 global financial crisis on bank
lending channel, this study utilizes the VIX (the S&P 500 implied volatility index) in
sub-section 4.2.4 to test. Results in sub-section 4.2.4 show that bank lending channel is
stronger in crisis, besides that bank size and bank capital have more impacts on bank
lending channel in crisis. That are interesting results in finding the implications for
Vietnamese policy makers in facing to the crisis.



5.3.   Academic contributions

       This thesis makes some important contributions both to the literature on the
monetary policy transmission and the bank lending channel. Among other channels, the
existing literature on monetary policy transmission has shown that the interest rate
                                           138


channel, exchange rate channel, asset price channel, and credit channel are channels of
monetary policy (see Section 2.2 in Chapter 2), similarly the credit channel literature
has already established that bank lending channel which is also an important channel in
the credit channel (see Section 2.3 in Chapter 2). The results for research question 1 in
Chapter 4 provide strong statistical evidence of a cost channel, while the results in
Chapter 4 also can not find the statistical evidence of an exchange rate channel and an
asset price channel in Vietnam. Thus, as far as it could be ascertained, this is the first
study with putting all literature together to test all channels of monetary policy in one
model for a transition economy as Vietnam.

       With regard to methodologies in testing the monetary policy transmission, many
studies which presented in section 2.2 in Chapter 2 show that they usually study each
channel without consider all channels in one system. Yet, as far as it could be
established, prior studies have not taken into account one model for all channels. To
that end, this research adds to the existing literature on methodologies by showing that
we should examine all channels in one system with certain conditions which should be
modified for each country.

       Although this is not the main focus of this thesis, the additional results in Section
4.1 in Chapter 1 also contribute to monetary policy tools literature. This result shows
that policy rates are more effective for measuring monetary policy than money supply,
especially in small open economy such as Vietnam.

       This thesis also contributes to the literature in terms of a bank lending channel
in that the bank size, bank capital, bank liquidity and bank risk are more important for
an emerging market as in Vietnam. Therefore, along with bank liquidity, the results for
controlled variables related to research question 2, such as the lag of a loan level and
economic growth are important. This adds to the credit channel literature that both credit
demand and credit supplies are important in monetary policy transmission through a
credit channel. These add to our understanding as to how commercial banks respond to
monetary policy in a small open economy. Especially, this thesis contributes to the
literature in terms of risk-taking action in the banking system in that commercial banks
                                            139


are motivated to supply more credit to offset the decrease in profit due to credit risk,
especially in the contractionary monetary policy.

       In terms of methodology, this thesis also offers a number of enhancements on
existing studies. It examines the results (related to research question 2) with a variety
of measurement methods for bank characteristics which include several approaches that
account for endogeneity, and the results remain very robust with such estimations. As
far as it could be ascertained, this is the first study to use an interbank offer rate,
rediscount rate and a refinance rate to measure monetary policy in a single study (related
to research question 2). The use of such different measures of policy rate is important
because the use of one policy rate is subject to criticism such as it is not suitable for
proxy monetary policy in a small open country where their central bank uses more than
one policy rate to conduct monetary policy. In addition, the results for different risk
measures are important as regulators have different orientation towards monetary policy
tools. In addition, this study has contribution on the using proxy for the 2008 global
financial crisis by suggesting VIX, that is seem the suitable proxy in the case of lacking
data or other measurement for further studies. The next section identifies the policy
implications of this thesis in references to the results.



5.4.   Policy implications
       5.4.1. Choosing monetary policy tools

   In monetary policy conducting, a central bank can use policy rates, open market
operations, and reserve requirements to impact economic variables. In which, open
market operation and reserve requirements directly impact money supply, while policy
rate directly impacts market interest rates.

   The proper choice of monetary policy tools is debated in theory and reality. First
economist group argues that central bank should set money supply while letting interest
rate fluctuate as it is. Second economist group argues that authorities should manage
interest rates in times of boom and down in recession, while the money supply is
allowed to fluctuate as it is. The third economist group argues that monetary authorities
                                           140


should use both the money supply and the interest rate as instruments, of course the
money supply and the interest rate cannot be set independently, but the idea seems to
be able to maintain some sort of relationships between two instruments (Hamilton &
Wu, 2012). The choice of instrument problems are clearly a consequence of uncertainty,
and analysis of the problem requires more detail in methodology and it depends on the
national situation. In fact, many central banks around the world have used many tools
in monetary policy conducting (see Appendix 4, 5 and 6), but policy rates are preferred
in almost all countries with many different names (Goodfriend, 1991).

   In Vietnam, SBV can use open market operation, policy rate (base rate, rediscount
rate and refinance rate), reserve requirement, and other tools as stated in the 2010 state
bank act. SBV used the policy rate and open market operation in 2000 – 2012 period to
conduct expansionary monetary policy in 2000 – 2007 period and changed in the 2008
– 2012 period. The results of this study found that policy rates such as the rediscount
rate, refinance rate, and even VNIBOR are more effective in monetary policy
transmission than money supply (M2). It means that SBV should use policy rates to
conduct monetary policy in order to transmit monetary policy to other economic
variables effectively.

   Besides that, SBV seemly couldn’t control money supply (M2) effectively in the
2000 – 2012 period, SBV usually broke their targets of M2 growth rate many times.
Thus, it is better for SBV if they focus on policy rates to conduct monetary policy
instead of money supply. In which, they can use rediscount rate, refinance rate, and
even they can impact on VNIBOR to conduct monetary policy. As investigation, both
rediscount rate and refinance rate are effective in monetary policy transmission so that
SBV can use both rates.

   Rediscount rate focuses on a discounting window that provides funds through
rediscounting short-term securities for commercial banks and other financial
institutions, while the refinance rate focuses on refinancing window that provide funds
through refinancing loans for mainly commercial banks and other financial institutions.
In comparing short-term securities and loans, securities are preferred because they have
                                           141


more liquidity and have a better position on financial markets, while loans from
commercial banks have less liquidity and are less preferred on financial markets. So
that, it is better for SBV if they focus more on the rediscount rate that is better in
identifying market expectations and navigating market interest rates. In addition, if SBV
uses the rediscount rate, they can limit the risk-taking activities of commercial banks in
credit activities that help stabilize the banking system for Vietnam.

   If SBV focuses on the refinance rate, commercial banks may join riskier activities
through credit supply because they can use loans to get funds from SBV through a
refinancing window, it puts more potential risk on Vietnam’s economy. This is proven
in the 2000-2012 period, when commercial banks try to expand their credit portfolio to
offset the decrease in profit that caused by the contractionary monetary policy of SBV.

   Although, SBV should focus on policy rates with mainly on rediscount rate, it should
be remembered that other tools should be used when needed, especially in the open
market operation. Without the open market operation, SBV can’t support for the
stability and the safety of financial system, it also can’t intervene quick enough when
the economy faces difficulties.

   But, SBV should not create the moral hazard in the banking system that they think
they are guaranteed by central bank so that they can do anything to increase their profit
by doing risk-taking activities (Hellmann, Murdock, & Stiglitz, 2000; Nier & Baumann,
2006). As the same thing with open market operation, SBV has to control the level of
reserve requirements in line with the situation of Vietnam’s economy.

   It is best if SBV can coordinate all three tools of monetary policy in a system to
conduct monetary policy with both short-term and long-term targets. In the short-term,
SBV can use policy rates and open market operation to conduct monetary policy, while
SBV should use policy rates and reserve requirement to do it in the long-term.

   Besides choosing a monetary policy tool, SBV should conduct a stable monetary
policy because it helps stabilize the economy (Otmar Issing, 1997). The analysis in
chapter 2 finds that the instability in the monetary policy is one of the contributions to
instability in Vietnamese financial system and economy. In fact, the instability in
                                             142


Vietnam is partly due to the instability in the world economy that SBV can’t control,
but with the role of monetary policy manager SBV should not change monetary policy
too many times year by year in just a short like in the period from 2008 to 2012. While
in 2000 – 2007 period, SBV expanded monetary policy for too long without recognizing
the inflation risk from a high money supply growth rate and low policy rates. Besides,
the existence of a cost channel in Vietnam which is partly due to the fluctuation in
monetary policy that has lost the effectiveness of monetary policy tools. So that, SBV
should build a separate department with the function of monetary policy research and
forecast to support SBV in monetary policy conducting. SBV has to have good and
accurate forecast numbers of economic variables in order to make appropriate changes
in monetary policy.

       5.4.2. Appling unconventional monetary policies

   In normality, a central bank can conduct monetary policy easier than some tough
cases such as deflation, near nil interest rates, liquidity traps, or crisis. Thus, quantitative
easing program and inflation targeting policies are launched in many countries to tackle
these dilemmas. Vietnam is going to integrate more into the international market that
will put more problems on Vietnam’s authorities, especially SBV in monetary policy
conducting, thus SBV should learn new innovations in monetary policy conducting
from other countries to apply to Vietnam in the future.

   -   With quantitative easing program

   In Vietnam, the financial markets and the stock markets are small, the liquidity of
securities is not high. Vietnam’s open market instruments are mainly treasury bills,
while participants are mainly state-owned commercial banks, the scale is modest,
meanwhile the development of financial markets is one of the precondition for the
development of an open market and Vietnam is not fully developed to apply to this
program. Thus:

   SBV should study this policy to prepare necessary conditions if they want it to be
conducted in the future. QE program argued about the effectiveness to cope with the
crisis in Japan, England, and even in the U.S., therefore we must be more skeptical on
                                           143


this policy if we want to apply it. In preparation, SBV needs to develop the financial
markets, especial the market for bonds and other debt securities by preparing the trading
law system and focus on protecting investors and the integrity of the markets.

   Quantitative easing program aims at some targets: increasing the liquidity,
stimulating investment and consumption, and balancing the government budget.
Depending on the economic situation and the stage of the market, central bank has to
choose the most important target in QE implementation. However, if a central bank
increases the money supply to stimulate investment and consumption, and promote
economic growth, they will be faced with the risk of inflation if the increase in the
money supply is not highly effective to destabilize the economy after the QE program.
So Vietnam’s government and SBV have to plan with a more specific schedule backup
if they want to apply the QE program in the future.

   -   With inflation targeting policy

   The empirical evidence show that inflation targeting policy is effective in inflation
controlling and stabilizing so that SBV should study to apply this policy in the near
future to tackle the instability in monetary policy conducting. However, it can’t apply
it immediately in the current period because the inflation targeting policy requires some
necessary conditions that need to be prepared first. These conditions include:

   Construct an independent central bank in monetary policy. This is a necessary
condition for the implementation of inflation targeting policy. According to Hossain
(2009), Vietnam is a country with a high level of dollarization alongside other countries
such as China, Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, and Cambodia in Asia. While Vietnam’s
government has intervened heavily into the policy of SBV so that it almost has no
independency. Meanwhile, Vietnam’s government uses its power to intervene directly
into some sort of price so that the independence of SBV in monetary policy conducting
is one of the lowest in Asia and the Pacific.

   Construct an independent agency for banking system observation. Besides other
roles, SBV has to help the government in monitoring the banking system to ensure the
safety and stability in banking system and financial system. In many countries, they
                                          144


establish a specialized agency to monitor banking system along with central bank (see
more on table 4.2 in appendix 4).

   In order to ensure better control of risks in banking system and ensure better
enforcement of SBV’s policies, Vietnam’s government should develop a banking
system monitoring agency separately. It is also necessary to ensure the effectiveness of
the banking system restructuring in this period.

   SBV has to be more transparent with the information of the financial system,
monetary policy, foreign exchange, and all their activities. Recently, SBV has
announced some indicators relating to banking activities, but it should be more
transparent for the inflation targeting policy. SBV should develop a clear set of
indicators for monetary and financial system and publish them on quarterly or monthly
basis to ensure the information is updated quickly and efficiently.

       5.4.3. Developing debt and equity markets

   As stated, Vietnam has to develop financial markets including markets for debts and
equities more and more.

   Despite the development of the stock market in Vietnam with the initiations of HSX
and HNX in 2000 and 2006, the number of enterprises listed on the stock market is
small. Thus, Vietnam’s enterprises are limited in sources for funds, they still heavily
rely on the banking system, while the scale of the stock market is so small (table 5.1).
Banking system has been providing almost all funds for Vietnam’s economy, they
provided up to 115.39% in comparison to the value of Vietnam’s GDP in 2012. While
stock market capitalization per GDP was only 15.4%. Thus, Vietnam needs to develop
capital markets which focus on debt markets to supply funds for the economy.

       5.4.4. Capability of commercial banks

   Besides the changes in the monetary policy and other financial markets, Vietnam
has to make improvements in the banking system to make it safer and more efficient.

   Firstly, Vietnamese commercial banks need to raise capital to ensure flexibility and
defensive capabilities with macroeconomic shocks. In fact, results of this study find that
commercial banks with a lot of capital will be more flexible in responding to the
contractionary monetary policy and other macroeconomic shocks. But, commercial
banks should use retained earnings as their first priority source to increase capital which
will improve the long-term stability and avoid cross-ownership between commercial
banks. After retained earnings, commercial banks can issue new shares for domestic
investors or foreign investors. With retained earnings, commercial banks have to plan
on using and avoiding affecting shareholders’ interest. If commercial banks don’t pay
dividends, the expectation of shareholders will change thus the stability of the
shareholder structure will be challenged. In addition, if commercial banks pay over
dividend, their retained earnings will be decreased too much and they are unable to raise
additional capital as needed. Therefore, commercial banks should keep the dividend pay
rate at 3-10% per year, they can also allow existing shareholders to receive dividends
in cash or new shares. In addition, commercial banks may call capital from investment
funds or strategic investors. This strategy requires a good business strategy and
performance of commercial banks therefore they need to be careful to avoid bad effects
on existing shareholders.
                                            146


   Secondly, because the size and liquidity of commercial banks have a significant
impact on the monetary policy transmission and they respond strongly to monetary
policy shocks, thus Vietnamese commercial banks should: consider the overall macro-
economic factors, credit demand, their size and liquidity to plan an appropriate credit
growth plan in business planning. They should not expand credit indiscipline to meet
profit targets because it comes with risks and they will be lose their flexibility in
responding to macroeconomic shocks.

   Simultaneously with credit growth, commercial banks must pay attention to the
structure in their credit portfolio. Economists say that a diversified credit portfolio has
a positive effect on the efficiency of credit, while some other economists conclude the
opposite.

   Traditional banking theory says that commercial banks should diversify their credit
portfolio, they should extend to new fields which helps commercial banks reduce the
probability of insolvency (Diamond, 1984), this idea is due to the asymmetric
information problem, the diversification reduces asymmetric information problem and
then reduces the cost of financial intermediation. The cases of commercial banks in
financial crisis Argentina in 2001 and 2002 (Bebczuk & Galindo, 2008) is specific
evidence.

   Meanwhile, other economists support the idea that companies should focus their
activities in a particular industry or group of industries to the benefit of expertise in this
field (Jensen, 1986; Meyer & Yeager, 2001). So that the portfolio diversification may
lead a commercial bank into a situation that they have to compete with other commercial
banks thus this strategy is less attractive. In addition, there is also empirical evidence
that proves that the diversification has increased risk in commercial banks (Mercieca,
Schaeck, & Wolfe, 2007; Norden & Szerencses, 2005).

   So, Vietnamese commercial banks have to be careful in building a concentrated
credit portfolio or a diversified credit portfolio. Vietnam’s economy is still in the
development stage with many industries that are forming with high potential risk,
commercial banks should implement the following strategies in credit portfolio
                                            147


building: They should centralize operations in the specific areas which are their
traditional activities; they have to avoid rapid expansion that causes greater risks. The
2000-2007 period is a specific case; most of Vietnams commercial banks extended their
system quickly without quality control so that they a fell into difficulty in the 2008-
2012 period. Vietnamese commercial banks should diversify their credit portfolio by
products; avoid focusing too much on real estate and securities. Real estate and
securities are riskier than other areas, and they lose their value quickly in crisis.

         5.4.5. Risk of commercial banks

   Results of this study show that the liquidity and risk of commercial banks have an
impact on the monetary policy transmission through bank lending channel so that risk
management is an important issue of commercial banks. Liquidity risk was one of the
biggest problems in the banking system in the instability stage from 2008 to 2012
(figure 5.1), which has reduced the financial health of Vietnamese commercial banks.

   Liquidity risk management is a top priority in order to avoid the risk of bankruptcy,
it helps commercial banks in responding to external shocks. At the same time liquidity
risk management helps commercial banks have greater flexibility in their response to
monetary policy shocks. In connection with liquidity risk management, Vietnamese
commercial banks have to pay attention on bankruptcy risk. There are many bankruptcy
                                           148


prediction models, but Altman’s Z – score is one of the most reliable model (Anjum,
2012).

   E. Altman (1968) published the first Altman’s Z – score which uses five financial
ratios to calculate Z – score for public listed companies. E. I. Altman (1993) developed
Z’ for all the remaining sectors and other kinds of companies which can’t apply Z to
calculate Altman’s Z – score for commercial banks. Apply Altman z – score in Altman
(1993) to calculate bankcruptcy risk for Vietnam’s banks, results are presented in table
2.5 in appendix 2. Almost all commercial banks in Vietnam placed in the green or grey
cells (safe zone and warning zone). Some banks such as Phuongnam (in 2012), DAB
(in 2009), HDB (in 2008), Agribank (in 2003 and 2004) have z – scored below 1.1 level,
it means just a few banks were in a bankruptcy warning in the 2003 – 2012 period.
Many banks changed from a good situation (green cells) to a bad situations (grey and
red cells) in 2008, 2009 such as DaiA, ACB, Kienlong, PhuongTay, etc. but this
situation improved in 2010, 2011, and 2012. So, the 2008 global financial crisis had a
bad impact on Vietnamese commercial banks, but after many policies were
implemented by Vietnam’s authorities to stabilize macroeconomic, the situation
improved. In the stated commercial bank group, only Vietcombank had Z – scores in a
good situation, all the other remaining banks (including Agribank, BIDV, and
Vietinbank) were in a bad situation. This proved that the stated commercial banks didn’t
have good financial health in the 2003 – 2012 periods on average. Credit risk was one
of the main risks of the banking system in the 2003 – 2012 period that caused the risk
on the overall banking system so that commercial banks must manage it. During the
2000 – 2012 period, most commercial banks expanded their credit for higher profits,
they did not care about appropriately managing their credit risk, this is one of the moral
hazard problems in Vietnams banking system which Vietnam has to control.

   On the aspect of SBV in monetary policy conducting, they have to determine the
absorption and reaction of commercial banks to monetary policy shocks. SBV should
identify the characteristics, capabilities, and risks of each commercial bank which helps
SBV apply suitable tools for the banking system. SBV should not equate all commercial
banks in policy conducting, because it will cause difficulties for small banks with less
                                           149


capital and less liquid assets. SBV should divide commercial banks into some small
groups according to criteria: capital, asset liquidity, and credit risk, then they use
suitable tools for monetary policy conducting. Regarding the credit policy, SBV should
eliminate limitation regulations in credit growth for all commercial banks, they should
set a credit growth rate for each bank group that depends on capital, size, liquidity and
risk. In addition, SBV should be based on macroeconomic variables to determine the
total credit supply and the impact of changes in credit supply to other economic
variables to set overall appropriate growth rate for the banking system.



5.5.   Limitations and suggestions for further research

   Besides contributions, this study has some limitations. Although, they are not
significant to overall meanings of study but they need to be consider:

   Firstly, this study has investigated three main channels in monetary policy
transmission, but it does not include the expectation channel, and some sub-channels in
the credit channel such as balance sheet channel, cash flow channel, unexpected price
level channel, and household effects liquidity. In a perfect situation, this study should
check the existence of these channels; it will contribute to the final conclusions of this
study. But as stated, the expectation channel can’t stand separately from other channels,
while it depends on the trust of people in central bank. The independence, transparency,
reliability of central bank in monetary policy conducting and other policies decide the
effectiveness of the expectation channel that are nonexistent in Vietnam. SBV is not
independent from Vietnam’s government in monetary policy conducting, while it is not
perfect transparent and reliable in monetary policy conducting, especially people seem
to lose faith in the monetary policy in the 2008 – 2012 period therefore an expectation
channel may not exist in Vietnam.

   Besides that, sub-channels in credit channels such as balance sheet channels, cash
flow channels, unexpected price level channels, and household effects liquidity may
exist in Vietnam in the 2003-2012 periods. But this study is aimed at the bank lending
channel in the monetary policy transmission with the highlight of the role and
                                           150


characteristics of a commercial bank in the bank lending channel, while the data for the
balance sheet channel, cash flow channel, unexpected price level channel, and
household effects liquidity testing is micro data with specific at enterprises, households,
and individuals so that it is not easy to collect in Vietnam. Thus, this study doesn’t
investigate the existence of balance sheet channel, cash flow channel, unexpected price
level channel, and household effects liquidity in Vietnam; they should be studies in the
next research in the monetary policy transmission area.

   Secondly, the study about the bank lending channel has not incorporated the
macroeconomic determinants and banking sector determinants into models to test the
effects of these factors on the bank lending channel. In fact, this study focuses on the
bank lending channel with the specific data at commercial banks in Vietnam, it means
that this study considers the bank lending channel in one nation so that macroeconomic
factors are the same for all commercial banks. Thus, we don’t need to incorporate these
factors into the model, but this study has incorporated the crisis into the model to test
the effects of a crisis on the bank lending channel. Therefore, if we want to test the
effects of macroeconomic factors on the bank lending channel, we need to expand the
study to more countries that are different in macroeconomic elements. This should be
done in the next research in the monetary policy transmission area.

   With the industry characteristics of the banking sector, this study has not
incorporated the model of the bank lending channel because it has reflected a part
through the size and the capital of commercial banks. In Vietnam, there are a few
commercial banks in comparison with other countries in the world, in which state banks
that are big and have a lot of capital, while private banks are smaller, and foreign banks
are not presented much here. State banks are guaranteed by government in operations
so that they are more competitive in attracting deposits and lending activities. In fact,
state banks have more advantage in responding to monetary policy shocks so that this
study focuses on other characteristics of commercial banks in order to avoid putting
many variables into the GMM models that may make it inconsistent.
                                            151


   Thirdly, this study was done using data from the 2003 – 2012 periods. Although,
there was enough time for time series in monthly data for VAR and SVAR models and
panel data in yearly for GMM model, but if we can collect more data, it will be more
relevant in the conclusions. Besides that, this study was done on 29 commercial banks
which are almost all of commercial banks in Vietnams banking system, but if we can
collect all data from all of the banks, it will be better. The problem in data collecting is
due to the statistical problem in Vietnam, we can’t collect all needed data with a high
reliability. But the data in this study is collected from high reputable sources such as
IMF, ADB, and SBV with a good length for econometric testing models. Thus, if next
study can collect more data, it should run again all these models in this study to test the
robustness of the results./.
