                       CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION


1.1. Backgrounds
       Poverty reduction, access to education, clean water, sanitary, health care, etc.
are the top concerned among 17 Sustainable Development Goals - SDGs) which
formerly was Millennium Development Goals (MGDs). They are the important
issues and attract the attention of every country, especially the developing countries
like Vietnam. During the past decades, Vietnam has obtained remarkable
achievements in the socio-economic development and poverty reduction.
       Statistics show that the poverty rate has declined from 37.4 percent in 1998
to 5.8% in 2016 (Demombynes & Vu, 2015; GSO, 2016). The report also shows
that the poverty rate in 2016 in rural areas (7.5%) is nearly four times higher than
that in urban areas (2%)1. The statistics indicate that a large number of rural
households still live in poverty under poor living standards and suffer from the lack
of socio-economic opportunities. Income of the households in rural area is rather
low. In particular, a report by GSO (2016) shows that per capita income per month
of the rural households is, on average, 2,437 thousand VND. In the rural, per capita
income per month of the bottom quintile (the poorest) is 676 thousand VND, the
second bottom (the near-poor) 1,246 thousand VND and the top quintile (the
richest) 5,669 thousand VND. Therefore, it indicates that income of the poorest is
around 8.4 times lower than that of the richest, which is a great gap. Consumption
of the rural households is quite low. In particular, a report by GSO (2014) shows
that per capita expenditure per month of the rural households is, on average, 1,609
thousand VND. More specific, per capita expenditure per month of the bottom
quintile (the poorest) is 834 thousand VND, the second bottom (the near-poor)
1,154 thousand VND and the top quintile (the richest) 2,576 thousand VND, which
indicates a big gap between the poorest and the richest in terms of expenditure.

 New poverty line (Measured by income per capita per month) in 2016 is 630 and 780 thousand
VND in rural and urban areas, respectively.
                                          2




       Poverty reduction, income improvement and good health, especially in the
rural area, are the most concerned issues among the 17 Sustainable Development
Goals. In the world and in Vietnam, many programs and activities have been
implemented to achieve these goals, for instance, training, agricultural extension,
agricultural technology, finance, job creation, etc. Among them, credit is considered
as the most important factors in income-generating activities since the rural
households, especially the poor, normally face financial constraint. Without
accessibility to formal credit support, poor farmers are unable to expand their
production and improve their living conditions (Li et al., 2011).
       As above-mention, a large number of rural households in Vietnam are still
living in poverty. The poor have high demand for credit; however, credit market in
rural Vietnam normally faces the problem of demand excessing supply.
Thenceforth, the poor have difficulty in accessing formal credit due to the lack of
collateral. In rural Vietnam, formal credit is mainly provided by the Vietnam Bank
for Agriculture and Rural Development and Vietnam Bank for Social Policies (Ho
& Duc, 2015), and recently by microfinance institutions.
       Inability to obtain formal credit has inhibited farmers from improving their
living conditions. Therefore, farmers may rely on informal credit sources to support
their production and consumption even though they must pay a much higher interest
rate, which may push them deeper into ‘vicious debt circle’ with less repayment
capacity. The reasons why farmers still accept the high interest rate from informal
sources are its collateral-free merit and quick borrowing procedure.
       Since its birth, microcredit programs provide the poor with opportunities to
be more accessible to formal and semi-formal credit sources (Li et al., 2011). Some
merits of microcredit are collateral-free and to serve the poor. By definition,
microcredit is defined as a small loan granted to the poor so that they can run
production or do business to generate income and improve their well-being
(Microcredit Summit, 1997). Microcredit is found by many researchers and
practitioners to an effective instrument to improve well-being of the poor.
                                            3




Therefore, this research aims to examine accessibility to microcredit and its
economic impacts on welfare of rural households. Thenceforth, relevant policies
will be suggested to support the poor with better access to microcredit sources and
improve the effectiveness of microcredit in investment, thereby increasing their
living standard. Therefore, to capture these primary research objectives, the
following specific objectives will be included and analyzed:


1.2. Research problems
1.2.1. Accessibility to microcredit
       Morduch and Haley (2002) state that credits can help the poor to improve
their living standards or at least cover their living expenses. However, a research by
Brau and Woller (2004) find that the poor have difficulties in accessing to formal
credit sources; particularly, the poor in the developing countries have more
difficulties in accessing than those in the developed countries. In Vietnam, many
rural households normally have difficulties in accessing to credit, especially poor
households, households in remote areas, the minority ethnic groups, or households
operating in such fields with high risk as aquaculture, etc., These households always
have high demand for credit (Duong & Izumida, 2002) but they have some
difficulties in borrowing from semi-formal and formal credit sources such as banks
or financial institutions. Thenceforth, many households have to borrow from
informal credit sources such as friends, relatives, money-lender, etc. The
Government has taken a lot of effort to support the rural households with accessing
to semi-formal and formal credit but the result is still rather limited. To increase
efficiency of financial services as well as better serve the poor, it is essential to
understand the factors that affect participants in microcredit of the rural households,
thereby implying appropriate policies. Therefore, this study is conducted to
investigate the factors that affect the accessibility to microcredit sources.
       The objective of microcredit programs is to serve the poor. However, a
research by Nguyen (2008) finds that the number of poor households with access to
                                          4




microcredit program is lower than that of the non-poor. Thenceforth, this research
will investigate whether the poor households are better able to participate in
microcredit programs that the non-poor.
       In addition, one of the attributes of microcredit programs is that the target
clients are women. Therefore, this research also investigates the role of gender in
participation in microcredit. In particular, this research examines whether the
female household heads can have better accessibility to microcredit sources than the
male counterparts. This objective is conducted using models with binary dependent
variable such as Probit or Logit.
       Research question 1: What are determinants of accessibility to microcredit
of rural households? Do poverty status and gender matter?


1.2.2. Microcredit and adoption of improved rice varieties
       Agriculture plays a crucial role in the economy of every country, especially
the developing countries. In Vietnam, agricultural sector contributes nearly 33
billion USD to gross domestic product (GDP) in 2015, around 17-percent share
(World bank, 2016). In addition, nearly half (46.8%) of the labor force in Vietnam
are employed in agriculture in 2013 (World bank, 2016). Agriculture contributes to
ensure food security and generate income for economic development (Datt &
Ravallion, 1996). Moreover, in the developing countries, agriculture is a major
income source of rural households that derives from domestic sales and export
(Singh et al., 1985). Therefore, the improvement of quantity and quality of
agricultural output is a focal point of the government in the developing countries
(Bonnin & Turner, 2012). However, the population in the world as well as in the
developing countries has increased more and more and the urbanization has been so
rapid, which results in less land resource for agricultural production. Thenceforth,
productivity improvement via expanding land area is no longer appropriate.
Therefore, the most possible solution to enhance production output is to adopt new
high-yielding technology.
                                           5




         Rice is considered one of the main staples in the world and developing
countries like Vietnam. In Vietnam, total area of rice farming is around 7,790
thousand hectares with total production output of 43,609 thousand ton in 2016
(GSO, 2016), which makes rice rank the first among annual crop. Rice is the
leading cultivar in terms of export volume with 4,835 thousand ton and rank second
in terms of export value with 2.1 billion USD (GSO, 2016). Rice production is an
important source of export earnings for rice economies like Vietnam. Therefore,
enhancing quantity, quality and value of rice is the urgent and important issues.
         Literature documents that adoption of improved rice varieties is considered
as an effective to enhance productivity due to their attributes of short duration, high
yield and climate-resistance (Sall et al., 2000). However, the adoption of improved
varieties may only become effective in enhancing productivity when being
combined with new fertilizers and modern cultivation practices (Karanja et al.,
2003).
         In practice, adoption of new technology normally incurs high initial cost and
high risk, which inhibit the farmers’ decision toward adoption, especially the
farmers with financial constraint. Several studies find that credit can facilitate the
households’ investment in agricultural innovation in general and improved varieties
in particular. This can be explained via two mechanisms (Eswaran & Kotwal, 1990;
Zeller et al., 1997; Diagne et al., 2000): (1) Credit relaxes financial constraint of the
farmers, and thereby they can invest in agriculture; (2) Credit plays a role as coping
strategies with shocks, including agricultural shocks such as natural disaster,
pestilent insect, etc.
         In fact, adoption of improved cultivar varieties may be affected by farmers’
perception, education, risk attitude, knowledge and management of agricultural
extension center, and soil conditions of the area. These models are complicated
cultivation practice and require more time, labor and capital than traditional
strategies since farmer need to pay more for new and certified agricultural inputs
such as seeds or fertilizers (Chi, 2008; Dung & Thanh, 2017).
                                          6




       The previous studies only investigate the determinants of adoption of new
varieties, but do not focus on the role of credit on adopting decision. Moreover,
most of the previous studies observe the behaviors of all farmers while there are
very few studies that investigate in detail the behaviors of farmers with and without
financial constraints or poor or non-poor status. In addition, most of previous
studies only investigate the determinants of whether to adopt the improved varieties.
There are still limited number of studies on the decisions of farmers in the two
stages, including whether to adopt and intensity of adoption.
       In Vietnam, there has been no empirical studies investigating the relationship
between microcredit and adoption of improved rice varieties. This study examines
the role of microcredit in two-stage decision of the farmers on adoption of improved
varieties as well as investigates in detail the behaviors of each specific group (poor
and non-poor groups). Therefore, instead of a simple model, this research employs
two-stage models such as Double-Hurdle (DH) or Heckman to clarify the farmers’
adoption decisions in two stages. For robustness check, such models as Tobit are
also applied for comparison.
       Research question 2: Does microcredit enhance the farmers’ decision on
adoption of improved rice varieties in two stages, including whether to adopt and
how much to adopt?


1.2.3. Impact of microcredit on households’ welfare
       Microcredit programs have been applied in many countries as a tool of
poverty reduction and hunger eradication. The impact of microcredit on living
standard of rural households has been studied by many scholars, practitioners and
policymakers. However, their findings are mixed and inconsistent.
       Khandker (1998) and Yunus (2003) consider microcredit as a tool for the
goal of fighting poverty and improving welfare. Microcredit is also found to have
positive and significant effect on welfare of the rural households via improving their
consumption and/or consumption (Li et al., 2011b; Mahjabeen, 2008). It is also
                                          7




proved that households with access to microcredit can improve their children’
health condition of (Pitt et al., 2003) or education (You & Annim, 2014).
       However, some researchers argue that microcredit has insignificant effect on
households’ living standard. Coleman (2006) finds no evidence for the impact of
microcredit on less wealthy households’ living standards, while Khandker and
Koolwal (2013) contrast that only smaller landholders benefit from microcredit via
increasing their agricultural income. Takahashi et al. (2010) conclude that
microcredit has no significant impact on various outcomes, except for sales from
self-employment for the non-poor and schooling expense for the poor, thereby
indicating that microcredit has no immediate impact on poverty reduction.
       In Vietnam, there have been many studies about the impact of microcredit on
the welfare of the rural households. The empirical studies show that microcredit
improves households’ welfare via increasing income, expenditure, self-employment
profits or contributing to poverty reduction (Nguyen, 2008; Quach, 2017; Lensink
& Pham, 2011; Ho & Duc, 2015). In some cases, microcredit is found to have no
impact on income, but only consumption (Phan et al., 2014).
       Literature shows that the impact of microcredit on welfare is still in
argument and the results are mixed among research and depend on indicators used
to measure welfare. While there have been many researches about the role of
microcredit in Vietnam, none of these studies investigate its impact on multi-
dimensional aspects of welfare. Therefore, this research is conducted to examine the
role of microcredit on households’ welfare reflected via income, food consumption,
and accumulation of assets. To capture to better results, this research applies various
advanced impact evaluation techniques such as Propensity Score Matching (PSM),
Difference in Difference (DID) and PSM-DID.
       Research question 3: Does microcredit improve rural households’ welfare,
measured by income, total production value, food consumption and asset
accumulation?
                                            8




1.2.4. Microcredit and health shock
      A research by Banerjee and Duflo (2012) finds that when health is improved,
people can study or work better, which thereby improves their future income. In the
developing countries, the social security system is not well-organized. Thenceforth,
when households face any health problem, they normally face big trouble,
especially the poor. Sytemmatic review by Alam and Mahal (2014) reveals that
health problems may have impact on household via some channels. For instance,
when the workers in the family cannot work due to health problems, it will lead to
an increase medical expense and a decrease the household’s income. The same
outcome may happened when care-givers cannot work to give cares to other
sick/disease member. To alleviate such burden, the households with health
problems will normally use a certain coping/mitigating strategy. However, when the
social security system is less developed and the formal coping/mitigating strategies
are not availables, the households may take advantage of informal coping strategies
such as reduced consumption, informal loan, or selling assets
      Regarding the role of microcredit in coping with health shock, there have
been few studies (Gertler et al., 2009; Islam & Maitra, 2012). These studies state
that households with access to microfinance can smooth their consumption better
than those without any coping strategies.
      In Vietnam, impact of health shock has been researched in few studies
(Wagstaff & van Doorslaer, 2003; Wagstaff, 2007; Mitra et al., 2015; Okonogi et
al., 2015). However, neither of researches in Vietnam investigates the role of
microcredit in mitigating the impact of health shocks, especially in relation with
other outcomes. Therefore, this research has two objectives. The first aim is to
examine the impact of health shocks on the households’ change in income,
consumption and intra-household labors. The second and more important aim is to
investigate the role of microcredit in mitigating the consequence after an onset of
health shocks. Regarding the inter-relation between microcredit and mobility of
intra-household labors after an onset of health shocks, there seems to be lack of
                                         9




literature on this issue, which thereby makes this research become innovative. This
study employs regression with Village Fixed Effect (VFE) using the data from
VHLSS in 2010 and 2012 to make comparison and capture the best results.
       Research question 4: Does microcredit mitigate the adverse effects of health
shocks on income, consumption and intra-household labor mobility?


1.3. Research objectives
       The primary research objective is to investigate the accessibility to
microcredit programs and its impacts on welfare. However, it is important to
capture the impact mechanism of microcredit program. Thenceforth, following
logical framework of impact evaluation in Section 2.5, this research includes the
following specific objective:
       (1) Investigate the determinants of accessibility to microcredit of the rural
households; in particular, whether microcredit targets the poor and women
borrowers. Further investigation is also conducted on the poor and non-poor sample.
       (2) Examine the role of microcredit in enhancing farmers’ decision on
adoption of improved rice varieties in both stages, including whether to adopt and
how much to adopt. The study decomposes research sample into the poor and non-
poor for further investigation.
       (3) Evaluate the impact of microcredit on the rural households’ living
standards, measured by various indicators such as income, total production value,
food consumption, and asset accumulation.
       (4) Investigate the mitigating role of microcredit when households face any
health shocks; in particular, whether microcredit reduces the adverse effects of
health shocks on income, consumption and intra-household labor mobility.


1.4. Scopes of research
    Microcredit is widely provided in urban and rural areas. Both banks and
    Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) provide microcredit. In addition, many
                                          10




    indicators can be used to define microcredit, welfare and health shocks. Due to
    availability of data, the research scopes are as follows:
• This research focuses on the households in the rural areas in Vietnam.
• Microcredit used for analysis is defined as collateral-free and small loan (less
    than 100 million VND) granted by the formal credit providers such as banks,
    PCF and other mass organizations.
• This research focuses on the microcredit used for production or doing business.
    Thenceforth, it may capture the long-term and sustainable impact of
    microcredit on welfare.
• Welfare indicators used for analysis include total output value, revenue,
    income, consumption, accumulation of assets, and non-working-age labor.
• Two types of health shocks are used for analysis, including illness/ disease/
    injury of any members and working-age members.


1.5. Research data
      Quantitative data. This research applies two datasets for quantitative
analysis, including Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey (VHLSS) in 2010
and 2012, and Vietnam Access to Resources Household Survey (VARHS) in 2012
and 2014. VARHS is applied to investigate the first three objectives while the
fourth objective is analyzed using VHLSS.
      Qualitative data. In-depth interview and focus group are conducted in rural
areas in Tra Vinh and Long An provinces to supplement the results from
econometric model and to imply policy.


1.6. Research methods
1.6.1. Quantitative methods
      This research employs different methods for investigating each specific
research objectives. Probit model using panel data is applied to investigate the
determinants of accessibility to microcredit (Research objective 1). Double-Hurdle
                                         11




(DH), Tobit and Heckman models with cross-sectional data are used to examine
how microcredit affects farmers’ decision toward adoption of improved rice
varieties (Research objective 2). Such impact evaluation techniques as Difference
in difference (DID) and PSM-DID with panel data are applied to assess the effects
of microcredit on living standard (Research objective 3). Regression with Village-
Fixed-Effect (VFE) with panel data is employed to analyze the role of microcredit
in mitigating the consequence of health shocks (Research objective 4).


1.6.2. Qualitative methods
       According to Merriam (1998), Bogdan and Biklen (1992), and Creswell
(2003), qualitative research may be conducted using: observation, In-depth
Interview (Face to Face, Focus group, phone), Media (Photo, Recording). This
research employs in-depth interview and focus group to capture the deeper
understanding about the research problems. Qualitative research is conducted on the
subjects associated with microcredit programs, including: (1) Borrowers from
microcredit provided by VBSP, (2) village Officials, staff of Women Union, staff of
Farmer Union, etc. at some communes; (4) Specialists in the fields of rural finance.


1.7. Contribution of the research
1.7.1. Theoretical contributions
       The dissertation is an empirical work, which mainly uses applied
econometrics and models from previous studies to testify for the case of Vietnam.
However, the dissertation still makes some contributions to literature, including:
    • The dissertation modifies an analytical framework on mechanisms through
        which microcredit can affect farmers’ decisions on adoption of improved
        rice varieties or other investment choices, then impact households’ welfare,
        and finally mitigate the adverse effect of health shocks.
    • The dissertation modifies and test empirical models of the determinants of
        accessibility to microcredit.
                                            12




    • The dissertation also makes contributions on literature about the effects of
         microcredit on farmers’ decision on whether to adopt and how much to
         adopt improved rice varieties.
    • The dissertation examines the role of microcredit in mitigating the effects of
         health shocks in relation with intra-household labor mobility, which then
         makes a significant contribution to literature in this field.
    • In addition, for each research objective, different applied econometrics
         methods are employed for robust checks to capture better results. Also, the
         dissertation decomposes research sample to different groups for further
         investigation to capture a thorough understanding.
    • Finally, the dissertation contributes to the academic aspect regarding policy
         analysis methods using IV 2SLS and PSM-DID.


1.7.2. Practical contributions
        Poverty alleviation, good education, gender equality and good health are the
top concerns in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Microcredit is
considered as an effective tool for improving household well-being. Therefore:
    •    The dissertation will be an evidence for the local authorities, policy-makers
         and practitioners to recognize and understand the role of microcredit in
         fostering investment and then improving living standard of the rural
         households. Thenceforth, they can disseminate the similar programs to
         better support the rural households.
    •    Moreover, the dissertation provides policy implications toward improving
         households’ accessibility to microcredit to increase the outreach of
         microcredit, especially to the poor or the disadvantaged.
    •    Other relevant supporting policies, but not directly related to microcredit,
         are also implied to improve the effectiveness of microcredit programs.
                                          13




    •    The empirical findings from the dissertation will suggest important policy
         implications related to microcredit programs, not only in Vietnam but also
         in other emerging, transition and low- and middle- income economies.

                 CHAPTER 2 – LITERATURE REVIEW
       This chapter describes literature of microcredit, including definition,
characteristics, theory and empirical studies, thenceforth establishing analytical
framework. This chapter includes five sections. Section 2.1 presents some
overviews of microcredit. Section 2.2 presents some theories associated with credit
and microcredit. Section 2.3 describes empirical studies relevant to four research
objectives. Section 2.4 briefly discussion definition of welfare. Section 2.5 present
the logical framework connecting the general and specific research objectives.

2.1. Overview of microcredit
2.1.1. Some definitions
       Microfinance is considered as an effective tool for fighting poverty and
eradicating hunger. Microfinance was initiated by the Grameen Bank - founded and
managed by Prof. Muhammad Yunus, who gained the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006.


       - Microfinance
       ADB (2000): “Microfinance is the provision of a broad range of financial
services such as deposits, loans, payment services, money transfers, and insurance
to poor and low-income households and, their microenterprises”. Microfinance
services are provided by three sources: (1) formal sector (Banks, cooperatives); (2)
semi-formal sector (Non-government organizations); (3) informal sector (money
lenders, friends or relatives, shopkeepers). Thenceforth, Institutional microfinance
is defined as microfinance services granted by formal and semi-formal sectors.
       Morduch (1999): “Microfinance is defined as the provision of small-scale
financial services for the poor”.
       Dasgupta and Rao (2003): “Micro-finance is a financial service of small
quantity provided by financial institutions to the poor. These services may include
credit, savings, insurance, leasing, money transfer, etc. that are provided to clients
to meet their financial needs.”
                                           15




       - Microcredit
       The Microcredit Summit (1997): “Microcredit is a program which extend
small loans to very poor people for self-employment projects that generate income,
allowing them to care for themselves and their families”
       Ault and Spicer (2008): “microcredit is a model of lending that give small
loans to the poor who lack access to formal financial institutions”.
       Dash (2012): “Microcredit symbolizes small loans extended to very poor
people for self-employment projects that generate income, allowing them to care for
themselves and their families”.


2.2.2. Characteristics of microcredit
       Literature document that microcredit may include the following attributes:
       (1) Small loan size. The term “small loan" may vary in each country. In
Vietnam, amount of formal microcredit ranges from less than 10 up to 100 million
VND (Khoi et al, 2013; Thanh, 2017; Thanh & Dung, 2017).
       (2) Targeting the poor. Microcredit targets the poor and low-income
households (Morduch, 1999; Du, 2004; Dasgupta & Rao, 2003)
       (3) No collateral. Collateral is normally required to reduce default risk by the
formal lenders. However, the poor lack of assets for collateral, which inhibits them
from accessing formal credit. Microcredit is collateral-free, which thereby increases
the poor’s accessibility to credit (Li et al., 2011a; Thanh, 2017).
       (4) For investment purpose. Borrowers may use microcredit to invest in
either farm or on-farm activities (Khandker & Koolwal, 2016).
       (2) High interest rate. The rate may vary from 15 to 35 percent per year.
However, Li et al. (2011a) state that rural households in China prefer microcredit to
other credit because of its affordable interest.
        (6) Group-lending scheme. Due to no requirement for collateral, following
this scheme, the members of credit group will monitor the others and be responsible
for the latter’ repayment. If a member defaults the loan, the remaining members
                                         16




may have difficulty in obtaining the loan from the program in the future. Group-
lending scheme is considered as a “social collateral”. Thenceforth, the lenders can
reduce risks of default by the borrowers and transaction costs (Anderson & Nina,
2000; Besley & Coate, 1995).
      (7) Targeting women. Around 74 percent of all microcredit borrowers in the
world are women (Cheston & Kuhn, 2002). Thenceforth, it indicates that
microcredit programs mostly target female clients.
      Based on the characteristics of microcredit and the availability of data, in this
research, microcredit used for analysis of the first three objectives is defined as
small amount (less than 100 million dong) from formal sources, used for the
purpose of production or self-employment. For the final research objective, the
purpose of microcredit is extended, including for consumption.


2.2. Theory
2.2.1. Overview of rural credit market
      Credit markets are intermediation between savers and borrowers. Credit
markets are characterized by such problems as risk and information, and they are
distinguished from good and services markets (Hoff and Stiglitz, 1990, 1997).
Similar to credit market in general, rural credit markets are normally imperfect and
more so in the less developing countries (LDCs). Some plausible explanations are:
   • The transaction of ‘buying’ (borrowing) and ‘paying up’ (repayment) are
      made separately in time. Normally, ‘buying’ process is made beforehand; the
      repayment is made latter (normally, after the investment cycle). That is,
      many livelihood strategies, especially agricultural production are spread over
      time, in particular farmers invest today, but reap outcomes tomorrow.
   • Lenders are unable or have limited ability to monitor what borrowers do with
      a loan (e.g. use for too risky projects or for wrong purposes). There is a
      possibility of default because borrowers may be unable to repay due to
      uncertain outcomes in agricultural production, loss in business or losing jobs.
                                          17




      In some cases, if borrower feels better off not returning the loan, he will not.
      The problem of willing to repay occurs if contract enforcement is weak, and
      taking borrowers to court tends to be more costly. Another reason is that the
      borrower’s liability is limited, When the borrowers default the loan, credit
      officers may share a part of liability.
   • Due to imperfect information, inability or limited ability to monitor and
      possibility of default, there exists large share of informal credit providers in
      developing countries. This is because informal sector has stronger
      enforcement and better information and monitoring.
       In rural credit market, lenders seem to be more careful than borrowers.
Lenders are, especially informal lenders, use indirect or direct screening
mechanisms to address problems of incentives and enforcement. To prevent adverse
selection or/and moral hazard, the lenders normally screen and monitor the
borrowers, obtain collateral from borrowers; or threaten to reduce the future loan.
   • Borrowers differ in their probability of default, and it is costly to specify the
      risk level for each borrower. This problem is conventionally known as
      screening. Lenders screen the borrowers regarding the available information.
   • It is costly to make sure that borrowers take actions which make higher
      probability of repayment. This is called incentives problem.
   • It is difficult to make repayment compulsory. This problem is known as
      enforcement.
       Rural credit market in developing countries is characterized by the variation
in interest rate. The annual interest rate in rural area of LDCs is normally higher
than that of developed countries. Informal sector charges higher rate than formal
sector; for instance, Siamwalla et al. (1990): study of rural credit markets in
Thailand, found informal sector annual interest rate to be 60% whereas formal
sector rate ranged from 12-14%. This may be explained partly by monopoly.
Informal credit provider can charge different interest rate on different borrowers
using price discrimination strategy. Monopoly power is established by natural entry
                                          18




barriers which is reflected via transaction cost. However, monopoly power of
informal lender is restricted because of the presence of formal sector (for instance,
public banks) and recently the semi-formal sectors.
       Borrowers can borrow only up to a limited amount at a given interest rate,
and will not be granted a greater amount even if they are willing to pay higher rate.
The poor normally face difficulties in borrowing at any interest rate. This indicates
that credit market does not follow standard demand-supply equilibrium.
       In credit market, sources of demand for credit include (1) Fixed capital for
new startups or expansion of production (machines, buildings); (2) Working capital
for on-going production because of time lag between putting in inputs and reaping
outputs; and (3) Consumption credit for consumption smoothing. Among them,
fixed capital is mainly vital for overall growth and working capital and consumption
credit are important for agricultural population.
       Poor people normally face difficulties in accessing credit, especially formal
credit. The reasons for loan application rejection may be due to the poor’s lack of
collateral to ensure their loan repayment ability, imperfect information between
them and lenders and high transaction and administrative cost. Moreover, lending to
the poor may be riskier since they may lose everything if they encounter
unanticipated shocks such as health, natural disaster, etc. Therefore, the big question
is whether the poor should be crowded out of rural credit market, especially formal
or/and semi-formal credit? The answer should be no since it involves efficiency of
capital problems.
       When the market is perfect, the allocation of credit will not rely on the
wealth, but rather on the marginal return of capital. In order to attract lenders, the
poor without initial capital will be willing to accept higher interest rates. However,
when market is imperfect, it is difficult to eliminate such problems moral hazard
and adverse selection (Armendáriz & Morduch, 2005). The formal lenders such as
banks or financial institution can not ensure that the borrowers will use loans
properly for right purpose, or repay the debt since the loan granted to the poor are
                                          19




collateral-free. Therefore, the formal lender will tend to charge very high interest
rates. However, the high interest rate will drive good borrower out of the rural credit
market, especially formal sector.
       When being excluded from formal credit sector, the poor will seek for an
alternative informal source of borrowing, for instance, relatives, friends,
moneylenders, employers, and the rotating savings and credit associations
(ROSCAs). In 1950s - 1980s, many governments in the developing countries
attempted to intervene in the rural credit market by establishing rural state-owned
banks to support farmers, especially the poor farmers (Morduch, 1999). However,
heavy subsidies, political interests and corruption have inhibited the viability and
success of these institutions. Loans were also diverted away from the poor
(Panjaitan-Drioadisuryo & Cloud, 1999; Armendáriz & Morduch, 2005). Therefore,
microfinance is considered as a solution to credit constraint for the rural poor.


2.2.2. Asymmetric information
       The rural credit market plays significant role in agricultural production and
rural development in developing countries. Formal rural credit market is typically
characterized by the disequilibrium of demand and supply, particularly excess
demand. Thenceforth, only a certain number of households who demand for credit
can access to formal sources. However, in reality, shortage of credit is not simply
attributed to excess demand but to asymmetric information.
       Asymmetric information is a situation in which one party has more or better
information than the other party. The later may possess no information or wrong
information about the goods or service in translation.         Theory of asymmetric
information is initiated by Akerlof (1970) and then developed and researched by
Spence (1978) and Stiglitz (1975). Asymmetric information may lead to adverse
selection and moral hazard. Asymmetric information theory is applied in many
fields and researched by many authors. This section presents this theory associated
                                          20




with credit market. Asymmetric information in credit market occurs when there is
difference in information possessed by the lenders and borrowers.
       Adverse selection normally occurs before moral hazard; that is, when the
lenders accept to provide borrowers with the loan. Borrowers often conceal the
information that may cause disadvantages, such as real income, current debt,
motivation of borrowing, etc. This may lead to the fact that the households who are
really in need of credit cannot access to the load or granted with an amount less than
their demand. Meanwhile, some households who are not really in need of credit can
access to full amount. The consequence may be bad to both parties: (1) The lenders
may face risk of bad debt or their credit programs may not serve target customers,
for instance the poor; (2) The borrowers cannot borrow from the credit programs.
       The adverse selection problem arises in the screening process where
transaction costs are associated with distinguishing between good and bad
borrowers. This borrowing cost may be reflected and compensated by interest rate.
Greater interest rate may compensate for high transaction cost in small loans, which
thereby drive out good borrowers. Thenceforth, only potentially-bad borrowers can
borrow. This may drive out the target borrowers of the program, for instance, the
poor who are normally unable to pay for high interest rate.
       Moral Hazard is associated with monitoring and enforcement mechanism.
The moral hazard occurs when the borrowers may not take effort to repay their loan
since they know the lenders share part of the liability (Pham & Lensink, 2007).
Therefore, these lenders tend to link default risk to household related characteristics,
particularly lender-borrower relationship and social norms. As a result, only a
proportion of rural households are unable to obtain credit or borrow an amount less
than demanded from formal sources. This credit rationing leads to the problem that
many rural households face credit constraints regardless of their repayment
capability (Armendáriz & Morduch, 2005). In other words, lenders decide whether
they should grant the credit and how much to grant on the basis of information on
                                         21




the borrowers that they have, thus not all borrowers will receive the loan that they
apply for or receive the full amount applied.
       To address the problems of adverse selection and moral hazard arising from
imperfect information between financial institution and the rural households, the
lenders usually require collateral to loans. The purpose of collateral requirements is
to improve creditworthiness and solve the incentive and enforcement problems
(Klein et al., 1999). Land (especially residential land), house, durable assets or
savings are always preferred collaterals when households apply to borrow from
formal credit sources. However, such collateral requirement becomes more stringent
since the borrowers are normally resource-poor. In some case, agricultural land or
productive durable assets may indicate the rural households’ capacity of production,
which thereby increase their creditworthiness and ability of repayment.
       Since one merit of microcredit programs is collateral-free, in South Asia,
high interest rates and loan costs reflect information costs of dealing with adverse
selection, monitoring costs to avoid moral hazard, and the default risk of borrowers
(Adams et al., 2003). However, the higher interest rates are, the more probability of
adverse selection and moral hazard effects it could lead to (Morduch, 1999; Cull et
al., 2007). In order to resolve this dilemma, group-based lending practice has been
implemented. A merit of group-based lending is to increase the effectiveness of
transactions, lower transaction costs, improve the outreach of microcredit programs
as well enhance loan repayment.
       Using asymmetric information theory, this study will answer the Research
question 1. In particular, this study focuses on whether the households of less
advantaged groups (e.g. the poor, women, etc.) can have better accessibility to
credit, as these groups are normally target clients of microcredit programs.


2.2.3. Theories on accessibility to credit
       Credit market follows the sequential two-stage lending process, where an
agent (e.g. household, firm) with demand for credit apply to borrow at the first
                                           22




stage, then lenders will decide to choose whether and how much to grant the at the
next stage (Aleem, 1990). Therefore, accessibility to credit, including microcredit,
can be conceptualized as a sequential two-stage decision making process that is
initiated at the demand side, and then followed by supply side (Zeller, 1994; Li et
al., 2011a; Khoi et al., 2013). This research will discuss theory of choice and credit
rationing theory and as “loadstars” for the analysis of accessibility to credit.

2.2.3.1. Theory of Choice (Demand for Credit)
       At the first stage (demand), an individual or a household wants to maximize
his or her expected utility from the decision whether and how much to borrow
(Zeller, 1994). Loan has its own opportunity cost which is reflected via the interest
rate and; thenceforth, the individual or household’s decision on whether to borrow
or not is a rational choice based on demand theory.
       Discrete choice model is defined as a model that determines the probability
of a certain choice as a function of the utility derived from that choice (Cramer,
1991). Discrete choice analysis employs the principle of utility maximization (Ben-
Akiva & Lerman, 1985). An agent will choose the option with the highest utility
among those available choice set when making decision. Accordingly, the
probability that an option is selected is considered as the probability that the option
may yield the greatest expected utility among other options (Train, 2009; Ben-
Akiva and Lerman, 1985).
       Supposed that there are two options a and b in a set of options (Om). Let Uia
and Uib denote the utilities that agent i gains from option a and b, respectively. An
agent will choose option i if Uia > Uib. Thenceforth, follow (Li et al., 2011a; Ben-
Akiva and Lerman, 1985) the probability that agent i select option a from Om is
expressed using the following equation:
                   Pr (a| Om) = Pr (Uia > Uib, ∀ a, b∈Om and a ≠b]
       Similarly, if agent i choose option b, then the function is as follows:
                   Pr (b| Om) = Pr (Uib > Uia, ∀ a, b∈Om and a ≠b]
                                           23




       It is noted that demand theory has been applied in many researches which
investigate the choice of an agent. Therefore, demand theory can be also useful for
investigating the demand for credit (the first research objective) and households’
decision toward adoption of agricultural technology (second research objective).
       For the first objective, households i will decide to borrow when utility from
borrowing is greater than utility from non-borrowing. Similarly, for the second
objective, households i will decide to adopt when utility from adoption is greater
than utility from non-adoption.


2.2.3.2. Theory of Credit Rationing
       Credit is a scarce resource due to the availability of credit. Accessibility to
credit is not simply explained by demand theory due to the fact that credit is
rationed under asymmetric information (Stiglitz & Weiss, 1981).
       Stiglitz and Weiss (1981) introduce the credit rationing theory on the basis
two primary assumptions: i) lenders are unable to differentiate risk level associated
with good (safe) and bad (risky) borrowers, and ii) loans are subject to the limited
liability of borrowers to repay loans (i.e., if the returns from investment are less than
the debt obligations, the borrower bears no responsibility in paying out of pocket).
       Credit market does not simply the theory of supply and demand as typically
described in markets of other goods and services. Suppliers (i.e. lenders) can not
simply use market price (interest rate) to charge the clients (i.e. borrowers) for the
quantity demanded (amount of loan). In other words, lenders cannot simply increase
equilibrium interest rate in the credit market because lenders do not have sufficient
information on the risk that borrowers will default their loans. Thenceforth, at the
second stage, lenders tend to ration the loans that will be granted to borrowers. In
other words, lenders will make their decision on whether the loan should be
provided, and then the amount to be granted, based on the lenders’ perception on
the clients’ credit-worthiness or repayment capacity (Aleem, 1990).
                                          24




       Stiglitz and Weiss (1981) initiate credit rationing theory to explain the reason
why some households can get the loan while the other can not. Credit providers are
able to judge the borrowers’ credit-worthiness based on the available information
during the screening process. Without sufficient information, information
asymmetry may lead to at least two popular problems: adverse selection and moral
hazard. Adverse selection occurs during the screening process when lenders tend to
favor “good” borrowers but crow out the target clients (Khoi et al., 2013). Moral
hazard arises after the loan is granted. The borrowers may not make effort to repay
the loan since they perceive that the lenders may share the risk (Islam, 2007; Pham
& Lensink, 2007; cited in Khoi et al., 2013). In general, imperfect information will
affect the lenders’ decision on whether and how much credit will be granted.
Thenceforth, not all households can get the loan or the amount that they demand.
       When analyzing credit rationing, it is important to know the households’
rationing status. Feder (1990) define the borrowers who demand for more credit and
the non-borrowers who could not obtain credit are classified as credit-constrained,
and the remaining households are the unconstrained. To examine rationing status of
farmers, Jappelli (1990) employs a qualitative approach based on directly asking the
applicants and non-applicants about their borrowing experience. Applicants are
categorized into such groups as: (1) If they desire to borrow more, which indicates
an excess demand, they are partially credit-rationed; (2) Applicants who did not
obtain any loans are classified as completely rejected. As for the non-applicants, (3)
if they had intention to apply for credit but did not apply since their application
might have been rejected, they are classified as discouraged non-borrowers. All
these group are considered as credit-constrained. Similarly, Baydas et al. (1994)
and Zeller (1994) identify four group of respondents. The constrained borrowers are
divided into such groups as: (1) completely rejected, i.e. those who apply to borrow
for a loan but unable to obtain; (2) unsatisfied, i.e. those who apply and are granted
with a loan less than demand. The unconstrained include (3) satisfied, i.e. those who
                                           25




obtained full amount demanded; and the (4) non-applicants i.e. those who do not
apply to borrow.
       Following Jappelli (1990), Feder (1990), Baydas et al. (1994), Zeller (1994)
Ali et al. (2014), applicants and non-applicants can be categorized into five groups.
Figure 2.1 describe in details the procedure to classify such groups.
       Some main reasons for credit constraints in rural areas are (1) Too high
interest rate; (2) No collateral; (3) Fear of collateral loss; (4) No lenders; (5) Not
know where to borrow; (6) Fear of being rejected; (7) Don’t like to be indebted or
go deeper into debt. Since one merit of microcredit is collateral-free, the reasons for
being constrained when applying to borrow from microcredit sources exclude (2)
No collateral; and (3) Fear of losing collateral.

       Using theory of accessibility to credit, this study will answer the Research
question 1. In this research objective, the sample is also divided into the poor and
the non-poor for further investigation. The rational for this decomposition is that the
poor is normally credit constrained than the non-poor, which may make the
determinants of accessibility to credit have different effects among two group.

2.2.4. Theoretical framework of outreach of microcredit
       Assessment on the performance of microfinance organizations have been
relied on the concepts of outreach and sustainability (Yaron, 1994, cited in Navajas
et al., 2000). Outreach and sustainability are expressed in terms of the theory of
social welfare. At first glance, outreach indicates the number of clients served.
However, according to Meyer (2002), outreach is multi-dimensional concept and
we need to look in to different aspects when measuring outreach. Outreach is
normally proxied by gender or poverty of borrowers, loan size, loan terms,
transaction costs incurred by borrowers, number of borrowers, the financial and
organizational strength of the lender, and the number of services provided by
lenders. Outreach is considered as social value of the output of microfinance
institutions and measured by six aspects including depth, worth to users, cost to
users, breadth, length, and scope (Navajas et al., 2000).
      •   Depth of outreach is "the value the society attaches to the net gain from
          the use of the microcredit by a given borrower". This measure is to
          identify the poor or/ and women clients since society seems to value the
          net gain from a small loan for the poor or female clients more than the
          same gain for the rich or male clients. The poor may have difficulty in
          accessing credit from formal sources since they have no collateral or fail
          to signal their repayment capacity (Conning, 1999). Similarly, women
          normally face more difficulties than men in accessing the loan. The
          number of the poor and women clients serves by MFIs may be considered
          as criteria of outreach. Therefore, poverty and gender are good proxies for
          outreach.
      • Worth of outreach to users refers to the amount that borrowers are willing
          to pay for a loan. Worth relies on the loan contract and tastes, constraints,
          and opportunities of borrowers. More worth will mean more gain, given
          cost to borrowers constant.
                                          27




     • Cost of outreach to users refers loan-related costs incurred by borrowers.
         These costs may include: (1) price (interest rate and fees); and (2)
         transaction costs in forms of loan-related cash expenses such as
         documents, transport, communication, postal, taxes, etc. or/and non-cash
         opportunity cost such as value of time to access and repay the loan.
         Among these costs, only price paid by borrowers is revenue for lenders,
         while transaction cost is not.
     • Breadth of outreach means the number of borrowers. Breath is important
         since the demand of the poor normally exceeds the supply of aid dollars.
     • Length of outreach indicates the time frame in which an MFI produces
         loans. Length of outreach is important since the society care about both
         short- and long-term welfare of the poor. Without length of outreach,
         MFIs only enhance the short-term welfare of the poor, but not their long-
         term welfare.
     • Scope of outreach is the number of types of financial contracts offered by
         an MFI.
      Using this theory, especially the depth of outreach and cost of outreach to
users, this study will answer the Research question 1. Using the concept Length of
outreach, this study will answer the Research questions 3 and 4 using panel data.


2.2.5. Farm household model under credit constraint
      In economic theory on agricultural (farm) household model, the problems of
decisions on production, consumption and labor supply (leisure) are normally
analyzed separately through the behavior of three classes of agents (Singh et al.,
1986; Sadoulet & de Janvry, 1995).
   • Producers: Ones who optimize profit in regard to the volumes of products
      and factors of production, subject to constraints determined by market prices,
      fixed factors (assets and infrastructure), technology, etc.
                                                     28




   • Consumers: Ones who optimize their utility in regard to the levels of goods
       consumed subject to constraints determined by market prices, income,
       household-specific characteristics, preference, etc.
   • Workers: Ones who maximize utility in regard to income and leisure (home
       time (or home time) subject to the constraints determined by the market
       wage, total time endowment available and worker-specific attributes.
       When the three decisions are separably made, they are expressed by the
following separate models.


2.2.5.1. Producer Problem
       As producers, farm households are assumed to maximize the following profit
equation:
                                   Max  = pa qa − px x − wl
                                   qa , x ,l

       Subject to the following production function:
                                               g (qa , x, l; Z p ) = 0

       Where
       qa , pa : quantity and market price of product a produced, respectively.
       x , px : quantity and market price of production factor x used, respectively.
       l,w     : quantity and market price (wage) of labor used, respectively.
       Zp      : fixed factor and producer characteristics (fixed capital, farm size,
               ability, infrastructure, etc.).


2.2.5.2. Consumer Problem
       As consumers, farm households are assumed to maximize the following
utility equation:
                                          Max U (ca , cm ; Z c )
                                           ca , cm

       Subject to the following budget constraint:
                                               pa ca + pmcm = y
                                                     29




       Where, ca and pa denote quantity and market price of product a (agricultural
goods) consumed, respectively. cm and pm denote quantity and market price of
product m (manufactured goods) consumed, respectively. y is disposal income. Zc
represents Households-specific characteristics (household size, number of children,
elderly or women, etc.).


2.2.5.3. Worker Problem
       As workers, farm households are assumed to maximize the following utility
equation:
                                          MaxU (cl , y; Z w )
                                            cl , y


       Subject to the following income constraint:              y = wl s

       and time constraint:                                     cl + l s = E

       These two constraints can be merge into one equation (full income
constraint) as follows:
                                               y + wcl = wE

       Where, cl denotes leisure time (home time). ls and w denote time worked and
market price (wage), respectively. E is total time endowment availability. y
represents disposal income. Zc denotes worker characteristics.
       Singh et al. (1986) state that under standard household model where
decisions on production and consumption are assumed to be made separably. That
is, under separability, decisions on the use of resources (for instance, capital) for
production can be taken independently of consumption decisions.
       However, separability breaks down when there is a market failure such that
decisions on production and consumption would be made simultaneously.
       The three problems (Producer, consumer and worker) must be integrated into
one single household problem.

                                   Max U (ca , cm , cl ; Z h )
                              qa , x ,l ,ca ,cm ,cl
                                                     30




       where, Zc denote farm household characteristics.
       Subject to:
       Production function:               g (qa , x, l; Z p ) = 0

       Full income constraint:            pmcm + paca + wcl =  + wE
       where Full income constraint is collapsed from:
        px x + pmcm + paca + wl = pa qa + w(ls ) : Cash Constraint

       l s + cl = E                                        : Time constraint

        = pa qa − px x − wl                               : Profit function


2.2.5.4. Farm Household Model with Credit
       Since the primary objective of this research is to analyze the accessibility to
microcredit and its effects on investment portfolio and welfare, this section presents
the effects of credit constraint on optimal resource allocation. In order to
conceptualize the relevant credit market problem, the theoretical analysis is based
on draws on the existing literature on static farm household model.
       As above-mention, farm households are assumed to optimized the following
utility function:

                                      Max U (ca , cm , cl ; Z h )
                                 qa , x ,l ,ca ,cm ,cl

       The limited access to capital prevents the households from participating in
the markets. With access to credit, the households are able to invest in the fix assets
and to be active in the market (Duong & Izumida, 2002). Agricultural production
requires financing for production factors. To meet liquidity requirements for input
purchases, the household can take a credit (K). The utility function is then
optimized under the following constraint:
       Production function:                                 g (qa , x, l; Z p ) = 0

       Full income constraint with credit:                  pmcm + paca + wcl =  + wE + K
       Where, K denote Credit, including microcredit.
                                          31




       Using this theory, this study will answer the Research question 2. The study
also examines the role of microcredit in adoption of improved varieties for the case
of poor and non-poor samples, as the poor are more credit constrained.


2.3. Empirical studies
       Since four specific objectives are included in this research, this section, in
succession, will present empirical studies relevant to those four objectives.
2.3.1 Determinants of rural households’ accessibility to microcredit
       As presented in Section 2.2.3, it can be conceptualized the sequential lending
process that is initiated at the demand side, and then followed by supply side
(Zeller, 1994; Li et al., 2011a; Khoi et al., 2013). In particular, at the first stage,
households with demand for credit will apply for borrowing, and then, at the second
stage, the lenders will decide whether and how much credit is granted. This
conceptualization facilitates empirical studies and enables empirical models to be
estimable. Zeller (1994) states that the borrowers and lenders may make their
decision simultaneously and the lending process may occur at any stages.
       Attributes of credit itself, household heads (for instance, age, education,
marital status), households (labor, land, poverty status, assets), commune
(infrastructure, supporting programs) and financial institutions (procedure, interest)
are hypothesized to affect households’ demand for microcredit, which can directly
influence households’ accessibility to credit. As above discussion, accessibility to
credit can be conceptualized as a sequential decision-making process that is initiated
at the demand side (Zeller, 1994). This conceptualization is considered as a standard
framework for analyzing the accessibility to credit. Many empirical studies
investigate the determinants of accessibility to credit, including microcredit;
however, the results are mixed.
       Education level. Quach and Mullineux (2007), Barslund and Tarp (2008)
and Li et al. (2011a) find that higher education level can fosters households’
accessibility to microcredit program. With more education, households may possess
                                           32




more skills and knowledge, and be more exposed to risk, thereby increasing their
demand for credit. However, Khandker (2001, 2005), and Nguyen (2007) state that
higher education level of household head results in lower probability of microcredit
participation. The authors argue that with better education, the households may be
wealthier off, thereby reducing their demand for microcredit.
       Age of household head. Older household heads are less likely to borrow
from formal credit programs (Anjugam & Ramasamy, 2007). The older households
head tends to be more risk averse, and thereby less demand for credit. However,
Doan (2010) argues that the age has positive effect on accessibility to credit.
Meanwhile, Barslund and Tarp (2008) find no effect of age on accessing credit.
       Marital Status. Acessibility to credit, including microcredit, is found to be
higher for the case of married individuals and vice versa (Doan, 2010; Khoi et al.,
2013). Single individuals are normally considered as disadvantaged group with less
social networks, which thereby are less likely to borrow from formal credit.
       Gender. Banerjee et al (2010) and Khoi et al. (2013) find that there are a
high proportion of male borrowers from microcredit sources in the rural areas. In
rural areas of developing countries, men are normally the household heads and the
main decision makers with more social capital and. They may represent the whole
family when borrowing from formal or semi-informal sources, while women are
less empowered. Therefore, men tend to be more accessibile to credit. A research by
Barslund and Tarp (2008) in Vietnam argue that women are more likely to access
microcredit than man. In reality, some credit programs have the purpose of
empowering women, thus women may be their targeting client rather than men.
       Social Capital. Fafchamps (2000), Okten and Osili (2004), and Udry (1994)
find the significant role of relationship and social capital in accessibility to credit
sources, especially in the developing countries. Social capital may help reduce cost
of monitoring and enforcement for the lender, thereby increasing the accessibility to
credit (Okten & Osili, 2004). In Vietnam, there has been lack of studies
investigating the role of social capital in fostering accessibility to microcredit.
                                         33




       Household Size. Schreiner and Nagarajan (1998), and Ho (2004) state that
number of members in a household is positively associated with the probability of
accessing to credit programs, including microcredit. In Vietnam, Doan (2010) and
Nguyen (2007) also find that household size may increase households’ likelihood of
accessing credit sources. In contrast, Li et al. (2011a) prove that the households
with more members are less likely to access to microcredit sources. More
households size indicates more labors, thereby may increase the demand for credit
and then access to credit. In contrast, more household size may indicate more
dependency ratio, which decreases the accessibility to credit.
       Dependency Ratio. Husain (1998) finds that households with higher
dependency ratio have lower probability of accessing to microcredit due to their less
repayment capability. Meanwhile, Li et al. (2011a) state that dependency ratio
positively affects the participation in microcredit. In the case of Vietnam, Duong
and Izumida (2002) confirm that households with more dependents have higher
opportunities to borrow from credit sources. Higher dependency ratio may indicate
lower potential income per capita, thereby increasing their accessibility to
microcredit, as they may be considered as targeting clients.
       Ethnicity. Becker (1971), Yinger (1998) and Fafchamps (2000) find that
main ethnic groups have higher accessibility to credit program, including
microcredit. On that basis, for the case of Vietnam, it may be inferred that that Kinh
households may have higher opportunity of borrowing from microcredit sources.
However, Khoi et al.’s (2013) research in Vietnam find that non-Kinh minority
ethnic groups are more likely to access microcredit programs since they are
considered as the targeting clients of the programs.
       Land/ Farm Size. Land is considered as good asset for collateral in financial
transaction between borrowers and lenders, especially formal credit. Therefore,
landless households may have difficulties in borrowing from formal credit sources,
such as banks or financial institutions (Gale & Collender, 2006; Unger, 2002).
Davis et al. (1998), Quach and Mullineux (2007), Nguyen (2007), and Duong and
                                          34




Izumida (2002) state that households with more land have higher probability of
participation in credit programs, including microcredit. However, Khandker (2001,
2005) show that large land-holders are less likely to access to microcredit programs.
       Savings. Khoi et al. (2013), Quach and Mullineux (2007), and Fenwick and
Lyne (1998) conclude that savings (financial or non-financial) have negative effect
on access to credit, including microcredit. A plausible explanation is that
households with more saving tend to have less demand for credit and thereby it
reduces their accessibility to credit.
       Location and Geographic factors. Barslund and Tarp (2008) find that
distance between household residence and district center has no significant effect on
their accessibility to microcredit. Sharma and Zeller (1999) and Duong and Izumida
(2002) state that geographic location has significant effect on rural households’
accessibility to credit. Geographic factors represent the region or commune where
households reside (i.e. mountain or plain, remote or not), or location of the
households (i.e. distance from market, all-weather road, etc.). For instance,
households residing in mountainous or remote regions may be less likely to access
microcredit due to their lack of information and transportation. There are two
argument in terms of location. First argument is that households living in
disadvantaged regions are normally poor, thereby increasing their demand for
credit. Moreover, the households in these regions are target clients of microcredit
programs, which increases the chances of be granted with the loan. The second
argument is that households in these regions are more risk averse and the
borrowings may induce more cost, thereby reducing their demand for credit. For the
case of credit providers, transaction cost may affect their rationing decision.
       Distance to banks or financial institutions. Ho (2004), Vaeseen (2000),
Duflo et al. (2008) and Li et al. (2011a) show that the households who live the
farther from banks are less likely to access to credit programs. Similar to Location
factor, living far from bank, may lead to higher transaction costs such as
monitoring, travelling, or telecommunication. Therefore, it inhibits both
                                          35




households’ demand for credit and lenders’ decision on granting the loan (supply
side), which thereby reduce rural households’ accessibility to credit.
       Facilities of communes. Khandker (1998) find that the facility of the
communes may foster their residents’ accessibility to microcredit. These facilities
and condition may include post office, all-weather road to villages, radio
broadcasting station, etc. The facilities may benefit rural households in terms of
providing information and reducing transaction cost. Good infrastructures may
reduce transaction cost, thereby increasing households’ accessibility to credit.
However, communes with more and/or better infrastructure may have higher
development level and their residents may be wealthier-off and then have less
demand for credit, which thereby reduces the accessibility to credit.
       Informal credit. Many empirical studies on the accessibility of rural
households to microcredit often presume that there coexists both formal and
informal credit sectors, but investigate these sectors them separately (Pham &
Lensink, 2007). In some case, due to the complication in loan procedure by formal
institution, households will choose to borrow from informal sources, thereby
reducing their accessibility formal credit. Several studies have investigated the
interaction between formal and informal credit, but this effects on credit
accessibility are mixed (Kochar, 1997; Diagne, 1999; Guirkinger, 2008; Khoi et al.,
2013). Diagne (1999) concludes there is no evidence for the relationship between
the formal and informal credit sectors in the credit market in rural Malawi. In a
research for the case of the rural credit market in India, Kochar (1997) finds that
participation in informal credit is significantly associated with the accessibility to
the formal credit sector. More recent empirical studies by Guirkinger (2008), Li et
al. (2011a) and Khoi et al. (2013) find that suggests that there is the coexistence and
interaction between formal and informal credit sectors for the case of rural credit
markets in Peru, China and Vietnam, respectively; however, the interaction between
these two sectors vary among researches. For instance, Li et al. (2011a) find that
households with access to other credit sources are less likely to borrow from
                                            36




microcredit programs. Meanwhile, Khoi et al. (2013) argue that access to informal
credit sources is positively associated with the participation in formal microcredit
sector.     The literature document that informal and formal sectors are both
complementary and substitute credit sources. Therefore, this research includes both
sectors in the model for analysis.
          Based on these previous studies, Appendix 2.1 summarizes the determinants
on accessibility to microcredit programs. On the basis of literature review and the
availability of data, this study will select the relevant variables used for empirical
analysis. The variables used for analyzing the Research objective 1 will be
presented in Appendix 4.2. It is also noted that these variables are also used for
calculating propensity when investigating the Research Objective 3.

          The variables used for empirical analysis in this research objectives are quite
similar to those in previous empirical studies, however, as shown in literature
review, the effects of these variables are mixed, depending on methods and sample.
Therefore, the investigation of determinants of accessibility to microcredit in
Vietnam is still worth pursuing. The contribution is that it employs panel data with
difference models for estimation of determinants of accessibility to microcredit. To
the best of my knowledge, there are very few studies in the world as well as no
studies in Vietnam examining this issue using longitudinal data with various
econometrics models. Moreover, another contribution is that a proxy for social
capital is included in the model. Very few studies in Vietnam have incorporated this
information in the models of determinants of accessibility to microcredit.

2.3.2. Impact of microcredit on adoption of the improved rice varieties
          Agricultural credit, including microcredit, is a good way to overcome
financial obstacles in technology adoption to some extent. Many empirical studies
have examined the relationship between credit and technology adoption, including
new agricultural inputs such as varieties, fertilizers or breeds.
                                         37




       Credit is confirmed as the main determinant of adoption of agricultural
innovation (Feder & Umali, 1993). Credit is a tool that can accelerate the adoption
of new technology (Simtowe & Zeller, 2006). Credit, including microcredit, can
accelerate the adoption of new agricultural technology, namely adoption of hybrid
maize varieties by relaxing their liquidity constraints (Zeller et al., 1997). With
access to credit, farmers will shift from less risky to risker but more efficient
livelihood (Eswaran & Kotwal, 1990).
       Mohamed and Temu (2008) find that credit plays a significant role in
fostering households’ adoption of new technologies and the positive effect is much
larger among credit-constrained households. Kudi et al. (2011) find that credit has a
positive effect on adoption of improved maize varieties. Donkoh et al. (2011) state
that proportion of Green revolution inputs, including varieties, is greater among
households with access to credit.
       Abate et al. (2016) also conclude that access to institutional finance has a
positive effect on the adoption of new fertilizers and seeds. More specifically, the
impact of credits on adoption of improved seeds are positive for the case of
households with more than 2 hectares of farm size only. The authors also find that
only credit from financial cooperatives has positive impact on improved seeds
adoption, but no effect of institutions microfinance. Using Double Hurdle model,
Simtowe and Zeller (2006) find credit significantly increases adoption among credit
constrained households but has no impact for the case of unconstrained households.
More specifically, credit is found to have positive impact on the magnitude of
adoption, but no effect on whether to adopt.
       Teklewold et al. (2013) find that adoption of improved seeds is influenced
by many factors including credit constraints. Also, Shiferaw et al. (2015) conclude
that credit inefficiency inhibits farmers from adoption of modern varieties.
       It is summarized that credit can have impacts on rural households’ decision
on adoption of new agricultural technologies, including improved varieties via at
least three following channels (Eswaran & Kotwal, 1990; Zeller et al., 1997; Diagne
                                         38




et al., 2000; Simtowe & Zeller, 2006).). Firstly, credit provide farmers with some
capital when they are financial-constrained. The authors explain that farmers a lot of
expenditures such as daily consumption as well as agricultural inputs. To cover
these expenses, farmers may utilize savings or borrowings. When they have no
savings or are financial-constrained, credit can provide them with money for
consumption or agricultural investment. Moreover, credit can help farmers to access
new agricultural technology. Secondly, access to credit can help farmers Secondly,
credit can help the farmers increase their risk-bearing ability and select a coping
strategy. Thirdly, credit can smooth consumption. Therefore, when households
invest in agricultural production which may have potential risks, accessibility to
credit can help farmers smooth their consumption and mitigate these un-expected
risks. Thenceforth, they may decide to adopt new technology.
       Appendix 2.2 summarizes literature related the role of credit in foster the
adoption of varieties. Literature shows that almost none of empirical studies in the
world, except for Simtowe and Zeller (2006), examines the effect of credit on
farmers’ two-stage decisions on adoption of improved varieties, including whether
to adopt and how much to adopt. In Vietnam, neither of studies investigate the role
of microcredit on farmer’s adoption of improved rice varieties nor empirical studies
on adoption of improved rice varieties in general.
       This study aims to fill these gaps. Therefore, this research wil examine the
effect of microcredit on farmers’ decision on adoption of improved rice varieties in
two stages, including whether to adopt and how much to adopt. Some other
contributions of this research are that: (1) it employs IV to treat for the potential
endogeneity of microcredit; (2) the research sample is then divided into poor and
non-poor for further investigation.



2.3.3. Impact of microcredit on living standard
       Literature documents that there are many factors that affect living standard of
the rural households and the rural poor. Microcredit is one of the factors that is
                                            39




expected to improve households’’ welfare. There are many researches about the role
of microcredit but the findings vary among studies.
2.3.1. Empirical studies in the world
       Literature documents that the impact of microcredit is controversial. The two
arguments of microcredit can be summarized as follows:
       First arguement. Microcredit significantly improves the households’ living
standards as well as fight against poverty. Some typical findings are:
   • Microcredit has positive impact on living standard of the poor households via
       increasing their income, consumption, assets, health status of children,
       children’s education, income and assets (Pitt & Khandker, 1998; Pitt et al.,
       2003; Imai et al., 2010; Owuor, 2009; Yasmine, 2008; Adjei et al., 2009; Li
       et al., 2011b; Phan et al., 2014).
   •   Microcredit improves households’ accessibility to health care as well as help
       households mitigate the adverse impact of health shocks (Islam & Maitra,
       2012, Thanh & Duong, 2017).
   • Microcredit contributes to poverty reduction (Nguyen, 2008; Lensink &
       Pham, 2012).
       Second arguement. Microcredit is found to have no significant impact on
households’ welfare. Some authors prove that microcredit is no a “magic bullet”;
that is, its impact depend on each specific case. Some even criticize the role of
microcredit. Some typical findings are:
   • Microcredit has no impact on less wealthier households’ welfare (Coleman,
       2006), or may benefit the poor, but not the severely poor households (Hulme
       & Mosley, 1996; Morduch, 1998; Mosley & Hulme, 1998).
   • Microcredit has no impact on households’ welfare reflected via various
       outcomes including income/profit, asset, sales of farming/aquaculture,
       expenditure on medical care and female clothing, except for sales of nonfarm
       enterprises for the non-poor and schooling expenditures for the poor
       (Takahashi et al., 2010).
                                        40




   • Microcredit has no immediate impact on poverty reduction (Takahashi et al.,
      2010).
   • Microcredit only helps borrowers to better manage their money, but has no
      significant impact on their income (Rutherford, 1996; Mayoux, 1999;
      Rahman, 1998).
   • Microcredit may even result in negative effects, such as abuse of child and
      women labor, income gap/ imbalance, over-work, dependence problems,
      barriers to local economic development, and no contribution to poverty
      reduction (Copestake, 2002).


2.3.2. Empirical studies in Vietnam
      Microcredit programs are proved to have positive impact on welfare of the
participating households in rural regions, via increasing their incomes and
expenditures (Nguyen, 2008). It is also found that microcredit programs can
significantly enhance the poor borrowers’ self-employment profits and income as
well as contribute to poverty reduction (Lensink & Pham, 2011). The research also
finds that the income growth of borrowers of the poorest group is e higher that of
middle-income group. The authors also conclude that microcredit contributes to
poverty reduction. Microcredit programs significantly enhance households’
accessibility to clean water and modern sanity system (Reis & Mollinga, 2012).
Similarly, it is also concluded that credit is an important tool that helps the poor
households improve their living standard and escape poverty (Nguyen, 2005).
      Ho and Ut (2009) find that microcredit significantly improves annual income
of households in urban area. Microcredit is found to improve consumption but have
no effect on income (Duong & Thanh, 2015). Quach and Mullineux (2007) and
Quach (2017) find that credit significantly improves both food and non-food
expenditures, and reveal that the impact from formal credit is larger than that from
informal sources, thereby confirm the important role of formal sector in improving
households’ welfare. Similarly, Thanh (2017) confirms that microcredit
                                          41




significantly increases total revenue from earned source, non-agricultural food
expenditure and accumulation of productive durable asset, but there is no evidence
to conclude the impact of microcredit on total income from earned sources,
agricultural food expenditure and accumulation of non-productive assets
      Appendix 2.3 summarizes the literature review related the impact of
microcredit on households’ welfare in Vietnam and in the world.
      Literature well document that microcredit is not a “magic bullet”. That is,
microcredit is effective, depending on the main following factors:
   • Outcomes or activities of interest: Total Income and their sub-categories
      (farm or off-farm, crop or livestock), consumption and its sub-categories
      (food, necessities), asset accumulation (productive or non-productive)
   • Beneficiary: Poor or non-poor, wealthier or less-wealth households.
   • Time: Short or long terms.
   • Combination with other programs: training and consultancy programs,
      agricultural development programs, infrastructure, etc.
      Figure 2.2 show the analytical framework of the impact mechanism of
microcredit on households’ welfare. The framework is derived from Thanh and
Duong (2017) and adjusted from Stewart et al. (2012).
      First mechanism. Households may misuse credit for direct consumption
(i.e., clothes, food, beverage), which may improve welfare in short term. However,
this may lead to no capacity of repayment and households may go deeper into debt.
      Second mechanism. Households may use loan for investment in human
capital (for instance, health care, education) or housing (for instance, sanitary
system, water system). These may be considered as short-term consumption but
they may reap long-term effects. Better health and education may result in higher
future income (Banerjee & Duflo, 2012).
      Third mechanism. Households use loan for purchasing physical assets. If
they purchase non-productive assets, the consequence may be similar to the first
mechanism. If they purchase productive assets for farm or off-farm activities, they
                                                  42




may have more potential income. Thenceforth, they may use the earned income for
consumption, which may lead to better and more sustainable welfare in long term.

      Fourth mechanism. Households may use loan for investment in various
income-generating activities such on-farm (for instance, new seed/breed, new
fertilizer) or off-farm (for instance, vendor, small shops). Similar to the case of
purchasing productive assets, this may lead to higher income and then greater
consumption, which may ensure sustainable welfare in long term.
      Although there are many previous empirical studies examining the role of
credit in general and microcredit in particular, evaluating the impact of microcredit
is still worth pursuing, as the credit policy changes over time in terms of loan size
and terms. In addition, in the recent years, there has been few empirical studies in
Vietnam examining the role of microcredit in both broader and deeper
understanding using quality and/or updated data. The empirical works by Nguyen
(2008), Lensink and Pham (2012), Duong and Thanh (2015), and Quach (2017)
employ good estimation methods using panel data; however, these researches
employ the data from the surveys in the period 1993 – 2008, which is quite obsolete
and does not capture the new economic condition in Vietnam as well as the change
                                          43




in credit policies. Phan et al (2014) employ PSM to control for selection bias to
capture better results using the data in 2008; however, the author uses cross-
sectional data, which may not capture the information before treatment and may
yield bias. Ho and Duc (2015) apply DID method with more updated data.
However, the authors examine the impact of credit on income only. Therefore, this
study aims to fill these gaps. As presented in the Chapter 5, this research will
investigate the impact of microcredit on various outcomes (e.g. different income
sources, food consumption, asset accumulation) using PSM-DID method with most
recent data (survey 2010 and 2012). Another contribution of this research objective
is that there has been lack of empirical studies in the world investigating the impact
of microcredit on income from common property resources (e.g. catching
aquaculture from river, sea, or collecting forestry resources).
       As discussed in Section 2.2.4, the Length of outreach is an important issue.
This research objective uses panel data from two surveys; therefore, if microcredit
is found to have positive and significant effect, it may indicate that microcredit may
have long-term effect on welfare.


2.3.4. Impact of health shocks and role of microcredit
2.3.4.1. Impacts of health shocks
       Alam and Mahal (2014) define health shocks as: ”event of death or disease
or common illness with different degree of severity which impedes one’s ability to
perform usual daily activities.”
       There have been many empirical studies on the impact of health shocks in
households’ living standard and the results vary among these studies (Ravallion &
Chaudhuri; 199; Asfaw & Braun, 2004; Genoni, 2012). For the case of Vietnam,
there have been many studies investigating this issue (Wagstaff, 2007), Mitra et al.,
2015; Okonogi et al., 2015; Wagstaff, 2007; Thanh & Duong, 2017).
       The adverse effects of health shocks can be summarized via the framework
from Figure 2.3. The framework is derived from Thanh and Duong (2017) and
                                                     44




adjusted from Alam and Mahal (2014). This framework reveals that when any
working-age members cannot work due to health problem, it will lead to a loss in
earned income. Moreover, when any non-working-age members have health
problem, but they are too old, too young or too weak to take care of themselves, the
working-age members may temporarily stop working to take care of them.
Consequently, it will also cause a loss in earned income. Simultaneously, when
households have any health problems, the expenditure for medical treatment also
increases. From these two mechanisms, it can be summarized that the total effect of
a decrease in earned income and an increase in medical expense cause a great
burden to the households facing with health problems. Another mechanism is that
households may decide to forgo treatment after onsets of health shocks, which result
bad consequence in long term.

2.3.4.2. Strategies to cope with Health Shocks and Role of Microcredit
                  Health shocks normally cause bad effect on households in terms of physical
and economic condition. However, the impact of health shock may vary, which
                                         45




depends on the coping strategies that households adopt. Due to the burden caused
by health shocks, households may take their effort to reduce this burden using any
possible coping strategies. However, the households are not always possible to
mitigate these bad effects via formal coping strategies such as insurance, formal
credit, etc., then they sometimes take advantages of informal strategies such as
reduce the other (non-medical) expenditures such as food, education, sales of assets,
etc. (Jalan & Ravallion, 1999; Kurosaki, 2006; Kurosaki, 2011; Alam & Mahal,
2014). Therefore, they may be deeper into difficulties in short or longer term.
       Many empirical studies have investigated the mechanisms to mitigate or
cope with health shocks in LMICs. Genoni (2012) finds that households may rely
on cash transfer from relatives after the onset of an illness. Sauerborn et al. (1996)
find that intra-household labor substitution is the main strategy to cope with health
problems. However, this strategy is only able to mitigate the losses in production to
some extent, but unable to eliminate these losses.
       In Vietnam, the recent evidence on the mitigating/ coping mechanism is
limited. Wainwright and Newman (2011) find that households sell their liquid
assets after an onset of shocks, including health shocks. Nguyen et al. (2012) show
that households in face of out-of-pocket expenditure due to health problems tend to
borrow or reduce food consumption. Mitra et al. (2015) find that after an event of
health shock, households tend to smooth their consumption using vulnerability-
promoting strategies such as increased loan, asset depletion and decreased education
expenditures. Wagstaff (2007a) figure that households may partially cope with
losses in earned income due to health shock using unearned income sources such as
gifts, remittances, and pensions.
       Many researches have mentioned microcredit as a strategy to cope with
health shocks. However, there is a lack of thorough studies about what and how
microcredit can benefit households after an onset of health problem. Only some
studies by Getler et al. (2009) and Islam and Maitra (2012) find that access to
microfinance may mitigate income reduction caused by health shock. A research in
                                          46




Vietnam by Mitra et al. (2015) suggest that households in face of health shock can
smooth their consumption via some coping strategies, including borrowing.
However, except for the research by Islam and Maitra (2012), there is a lack of
thorough studies about what and how microcredit can benefit households after an
onset of health problem.
       In Vietnam, many empirical studies investigate the impact of microcredit and
find the positive effects of microcredit on welfare measured by such indicatosr as
income, consumption, self-employment profit, and so forth (Nguyen ,2008; Lensink
and Pham, 2011; Quach, 2017; Phan et al., 2014). However, none of these studies
explicitly explore the microcredit in relation with health shock of rural households.
       As abovementioned, microcredit is considered as a coping strategy when
households face any health problems. As discussed in Section 2.3.3, there are many
studies about the impact of microcredit on households’ welfare. Stewart et al.
(2012) summarize an analytical framework on the role of microfinance in
improving households’ living standard (see Figure 2.2).
       Taking together Figures 2.2 and 2.3, it can be drawn that microcredit can
mitigate the effect of health shocks through three channels. First of all, the
households can use microcredit to run production or do business to generate
income, and thereby use this income to smooth consumption and cope with out-of-
pocket (OOP) health expenses. Secondly, households in face of health shocks can
use microcredit directly for medical expenses or smoothing other consumptions
such as food and necessities. Thirdly, households use microcredit to invest in human
capital assets (for children’s schooling, reduction in child labor, and properly caring
for the elderly), which may bring about returns in a long run.
       Literature review show that very literature in the world and in Vietnam focus
on the mitigating role of credit when households face any health problems. This
research objective aims to fill this gap. Some contributions of this research objective
are: (1) It examines the adverse effect on households’ welfare; and (2) it examines
the role of microcredit in mitigating the adverse effect of health shocks. In addition,
                                              47




two types of health shocks and various welfare indicators are employed to capture a
deep understanding on the effects of different health shocks on different outcomes.
       Another important contribution is that rural households may increase out-of-
working-age labor in response to health shocks. Therefore, this study attempts to
examine the adverse effects of health shocks on labor substitution in association
with microcredit borrowings. The final contribution is that this research objecctive
employs IV to treat the potential endogeneity of microcredit.


2.4. Definitions of welfare
       As empirical studies on economic impacts of microcredit show, there are a
plethora of indicators used to measure welfare. Table 2.1 presents some definitions
and/or measurement of welfare variable (see Appendix 2.4 for details).

2.5. Logical framework of impact evaluation of microcredit on welfare
       The primary research objective is to examine the relationship between
microcredit and welfare of rural households. It is important to capture the impact
mechanism of microcredit program. Thenceforth, following logical frameworks of
impact evaluation, an analytical framework is suggested to examine this
mechanism. Figure 2.4 illustrates the logical frameworks of impact evaluation on
households’ welfare. On the basis of this frameworks, four objectives are
conducted. Figure 2.5 shows detailed analytical framework used in research.
       Research objective 1 (Needs-Outputs). The purpose is to investigate the
households’ accessibility to microcredit. As above-mentioned, accessibility to
microcredit may be initiated at demand side, and then microfinance institution will
decide whether households are granted with the loan. This objective examines
whether the target clients, such as the poor or women, can have better accessibility
to microcredit. In terms of research method, the estimated results from this
objective can be used to calculate propensity score for matching borrowers with the
most similar non-borrowers to capture the program impact in Research objective 3.
       Research objective 2 (Outcomes). By definition, microcredit can be used for
farm or off-farm activities. Before examining the economic impact of microcredit
on financial outcomes, it is important and essential to know which livelihood
strategies rural households may use microcredit to invest in. Therefore, this
objective will investigate whether households use microcredit for production or
self-employment. In particular, this objective examines whether rural households
use microcredit to invest in improved rice varieties.
       Research objective 3 (Impact, Goal). This objective further investigates the
impact of microcredit on households’ welfare. The logical framework is that after
rural households use microcredit for investment purposes (agriculture or self-
employment), it is important to capture whether microcredit helps rural households
improve their welfare using various outcomes such as income, consumption or
accumulation of assets.
                                         49




      Research objective 4 (Long-term Goal). This research objective will
examine the role microcredit in mitigating the consequence of health shocks. In
particular, it investigates whether microcredit improves income and consumption,
increase health care and reduce mobility of non-working-age labors when
households face health shocks.


                                      Needs:
               Rural Households face financial constraints, so they
                     need credit to do production or business


                                     Input:
              Bank/ Financial Institutions investment more in rural
                                financial market.


                                   Activities:
              Bank/ Financial Institutions implement various credit
                            programs for the poor.


                                   Output:
                 Households, especially the poor, receive loans.


                            Outcomes (Purpose):
               Households invest in on-farm, or off-farm activities


                                Impact (Goal):
                           Households improve welfare


                                Long-term Goals:
             Households can escape poverty, improve accessibility to
              better education or health care, higher social status, or
                                empower women.

           CHAPTER 3 – OVERVIEW OF MICROCREDIT
      This chapter describes the overviews of microcredit and Vietnam rural credit
market. This chapter includes two sections. Section 3.1 presents microfinance in the
world. Section 3.2 describes microfinance market in rural Vietnam, including
formal, semi-formal and informal sectors.
3.1. Microcredit in the world
      Although microcredit is considered as a relatively new issue in the realm of
development, this financial service is traceable to the 18th and 19th centuries, with
the Irish Loan Funds. Microcredit was initiated and promoted by Jonathan Switch
who is acknowledged as a father of this service. Jonathan Switch started the Irish
Loan Funds in the early 1700s to provide collateral-free credit to the poor in Dublin
(Reodman, 2012).
      In the 1970s, the modern microfinance was started by Mohammed Yunus
when he established Grameen Bank, an institution with the mission of providing
financial services to the poor in Bangladesh. This is marked as the development
phase of the microfinance service. Since then, hundreds of MFIs have established in
developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Similar to Grammen Bank,
the purpose of these MFIs is to serve the poor and fight poverty. In 1997, the global
microcredit summit was convened, which marked a watershed in the history of
microfinance. The summit provided a platform for improving the outreach of
microfinance service to the majority of the poor and the low-income as well as
integrating microfinance into financial system of many countries.
      As reported in 2013, a worldwide total of 99.9 million active borrowers were
served by 1,162 Microfinance Institutions (MFIs). Table 3.2 summarizes the
profiles of the ten largest MFIs, including their country, gross loan, number of
active borrowers and average loan size (See Appendix 3.1 and 3.3 for more
details). It is showed that VBSP of Vietnam is the market leader in providing
microfinance loan in terms of gross loan, volume of borrowers and average loan
size. Thenceforth, VBSP is also the market leaders among banks who provide
                                                       52




microfinance loans. Meanwhile, Bandhan of India is the market leader among Non-
Bank Financial Institutions. Among Non-Government Organization, ASA
Bangladesh is the top provider in terms of number of borrowers while BRAC of
Bangladesh is the leader in terms of gross loans and loan size per borrowers.

  It is noted that the data in this table is based on the information reported by all the MFIs in 2013. This does
not include the MFIs that used to provide but now stop providing microfinance loans (Normally, in terms of
short-term projects by NGOs, such as Plan International Vietnam, PNN or Save the Children in Vietnam).
Therefore, the table may not capture the whole picture of all market leaters in MFIs. 2013 is selected to be
reported since this year provides most-avaialable information of most of market leaders MFIs. The most
updated data is in 2016 but lots of information is missing.

3.2. Microcredit in rural Vietnam
3.2.1. Microcredit providers
      In rural Vietnam, credit market is described as fragmented, heavily
subsidized and highly intervened by the Government (Duong & Izumida, 2002;
McCarty 2001; Khoi et al., 2013). Moreover, the Vietnam rural credit market
includes three sectors that co-exists to provide households with credit service,
including: the formal sector, semi-formal sector and informal sector.
      As a component of rural credit market, microcredit shares the same pattern.
Figure 3.1 shows the specific microfinance providers in each sector of credit
system in rural Vietnam.

      Formal sector. The market is dominated by state-owned banks, which
includes the Vietnam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (VBARD), the
Vietnam Bank for Social Policies (VBSP) and the People’s Credit Funds (PCFs),
                                           54




which together control as much as 70% of the total credit granted in rural areas
(World Bank, 2002).
       VBARD. VBARD has branches at the district level and only to a limited
extent at the commune level; therefore, its outreach to the poor in remote and rural
communes is limited (Khoi et al., 2013). Moreover, operation of VBARD is
characterized as underdevelopment due to their biases in risk assessment and
complicated procedures in assessing and granting the loans (Putzeys 2002).
Moreover, a collateral may be required to borrow from VBARDS, which also
crowds out the poor from getting the loans. To overcome the weakness of VBARD,
the VBSP and PCFs were established to meet the poor’s demand for credit.
       PCFs. PCFs are established with the aim of restoring the public trust in
formal rural finance sector. The strategy of PCFs is to mobilize savings from its
members and then provide the poor with the loans. However, PCFs’ offices are
mainly located in the better-off areas with better infrastructure. Therefore, the role
of PCFs in providing the poor with credit is still limited.
       VBSP. The Vietnam Bank for the Poor (VBP) was established in 1995, and
its primary mission is to reduce poverty. Later in 2003, VBP was renamed to the
Vietnam Bank for Social Policies (VBSP). Since its establishment, VBSP has been
succeeded in supporting the poor in fighting poverty via providing various lending
services, including microfinance. VBSP provides credit at low interest rate to the
poor who can not borrow from other formal sources duet to their lack of collateral.
VBSP works with local governments to identify the households eligible for the
loan, for instance the poor or disadvantaged households. In addition, other mass
organizations, such as Women Union, Farmers Union and Youth Union, help VBSP
monitor the loans. Collateral is not required when households borrow from VBSP.
As a requirement established in 2003, VBSP provides the poor with preferential
microcredit via ‘group-based lending scheme’. Rural households need to be a
member of a credit group in their locality before applying to borrow from VBSP. In
order to become an official members of a credit groups, rural households must meet
                                            55




the following requirements: (1) Households are long-term residents at their locality;
(2) the households have members who are able to work, (3) the households hold a
poor certificate issued by local authority, and (4) the households demand for credit.
The credit is granted for the primary purpose of production or business. However, in
some case, the loan may be used for such consumptions as health care or education.
       Lending practice by VBSP follows group-based lending scheme; however,
this practice does not strictly follow joint-liability principle. As above-mentioned,
households should join a credit group in which there is a group leader. The group
leaders are responsible for (1) providing the credit officers with information of
members in the credit groups, (2) collecting the loan applications from group
members and distributing the loans, and (3) persuading members to repay the loans.
In case of defaults by any members, the group leaders or members will not liable for
these defaults, but the responsibility lies with credit officers.
       POSTAL SAVINGS COMPANY (VPSC). VPSC was established in 1999 with
the primary objective of mobilizing money from the public for economic
development. In 2011, VPSC has more than 11,000 branches and transaction offices
nationwide. However, VPSC has played a minor role in rural credit market due to
no function of credit provision. In 2011, VPSC was with Lien Viet Joint-stock
Commercial Bank and then renamed to LienVietPost Commercial Joint Stock Bank
(LienVietPostBank). The establishment of LienVietPostBank is to contribute to the
implementation of “Tam Nong” program (agriculture, farmers and rural sector).
After merging, LienVietPostBank has received exclusive rights to take deposits and
deploy services using VPSC's networks.
       It is documented that the procedure to get loans from formal sector may be
complicated, slow and induce higher transaction cost. Therefore, the existence of
informal sector is inevitable. Informal sector is documented to play an important
role in rural financial market in Vietnam (Putzeys, 2002; Duong and Izumida, 2002;
Pham and Lensink, 2007).
                                          56




       Informal Sector. This sector includes relatives, friends and neighbors,
Rotating Savings Credit Associations (ROSCAs) and private moneylenders. Private
moneylenders may provide loans in cash or in-kind, for instance inputs. Therefore,
they may be local traders or inputs providers. This sector used to play a large role in
rural Vietnam.
       RELATIVES AND FRIENDS. These are the first alternative and popular
sources of informal credit sectors. Loan size, interest rate and terms are determined
based on trust and relationship between borrowers and lenders. Loans are granted
without collateral. The interest rates are varied; that is, the lenders may charge
borrowers with interest rates higher or lower than formal sector or in some cases,
interest-free. One merit of this sector is swift procedure with simple screening
process. The purpose of theses loans is generally for consumption in such
emergency cases as health care, family events (funeral, weddings, etc.). Rarely are
these loans used for production or business.
       PRIVATE MONEY LENDER. Private moneylenders are popular and
considered as an important credit source for most rural households. Together with
relatives and friends, private money lenders used to constitute more than 51% of
loans provided in rural financial market (Putzeys, 2002). Private money lenders are
generally rich households with surplus money and goods. The interest rate charged
by these lenders is higher than the formal rate; in some extreme cases, the rates
range from 10% to 30% per month (Putzeys, 2002). Similar to loans provided by
friends or relatives, regardless of high interest rate, rural households still choose to
borrow from money lenders due to quick and simple lending practices and flexible
repayment terms (Putzeys, 2002; Duong & Izumida, 2002). The loans are generally
collateral free. In the recent years, with development of rural product markets,
private money lender may function as inputs suppliers or traders. That is, some
money lenders provide the loan as agricultural inputs (for instance, seeds, breed,
fertilizers, cattle-feed) at the beginning of season, and then receive the returns
including principle and interest at the end. Some traders provide households with
                                         57




cash in advance on the basis of the promise to receive or buy the products at harvest
time.
        ROSCAs. ROSCAs operate based on pooling resources among a limited
group of members who trust each other. ROSCAs are popular in both rural and
urban areas, at work and at localities. Number of members, loan amounts, cycle and
periodic meetings are decided by all members, or by the organizers. At each
meeting, each member regularly contributes an even amount of money to the total
fund, which is then allocated to one member of the groups. In the next meetings,
the other members will in turn receive the fund and the past recipients are excluded
from getting the total fund again. The cycle of a ROSCA ends when every member
receives at least one total funds. Most of the ROSCAs are established to meet the
short-term consumptions such as weddings, funerals or the lunar new year, but to
finance long-term investments such as productions, business, education. ROSCAs
have existed in Vietnam for a long time; however, they have not been regulated by
the Law on Credit Institutions. Defaults are commonly associated with either
ROSCA members or organizers due to the weak screening process among members
and weak social sanctions. ROSCAs are commonly cited as indigenous ways to
overcome credit constraints (Armendariz & Morduch, 2005). ROSCAs are also
considered as an effective way to promote savings.
        Semi-formal Sector. This sector is established by international programs and
non-government organizations (NGOs) in collaboration with local organizations.
This sector provides credit to rural households excluded from the formal sector.
Semi-formal sector is documented to play a small role in the provision of credit,
especially microcredit in Vietnam because it operates without a legal framework
(Le, 2011). Not until 2010 was semi-formal sector incorporated into the formal
financial system under the Law on Credit Institutions (CIL).
        In Vietnam, microfinance was initiated by Tinh Thuong (TYM) fund in
1992. Following Grameen Bank model, TYM was established and managed by the
Vietnam Women's Union (VWU). After that, other MFIs such as Binh Minh CDC,
                                          58




CEP, etc... have been established to provide microfinance services. However, at that
time, the operation of these MFIs was not adjusted under an official legal
framework. Therefore, due to the lack of legal framework, these MFIs had difficulty
in mobilizing capital. However, since the promulgation of the decree 28/2005/ND-
CP in which prescribes the establishment of small-sized financial institutions, and
the decree of 165/2007/ND-CP in which amends and implements the decree
28/2005/ND-CP, microcredit activities provided by theses MFIs has been developed
remarkably. As abovementioned, under the Law on Credit Institutions (CIL)
released in 2010, MFIs was incorporated into the formal financial system and
liberalize the banking operations, including the rural finance. After that, TYM
became the first MFI that has been formalized to become a credit institution.
       This research only focuses on the formal credit sector with microcredit loans
from commercial banks, VBSP and mass organizations. Credit from informal sector
is also included in the research model as a control variable. Due to the unavailability
of data, this research excludes credit from NGO MFIs in semi-formal sector.


3.2.2. Credit activities and clients
       Table 3.3 present some information about operation of microfinance services
providers in Vietnam (for more details, see Appendix 3.2). It is showed that such
institutions in formal sectors as VBSP, VBARD and PCF are the greatest providers.
VBSP is found to be the market leaders of microcredit in terms of number of clients
with 8.1 million borrowers and outstanding loan with 4,588 million USD, while
VBARD is the leader in terms of average loan size at round 1,094 USD. Among the
semi-formal MFIs, CEP and TYM are the largest microfinance providers. The
average loan size from MFIs is about 125 USD, which is quite small.
       Regarding interest rate, the average interest rate of VBSP loans is
0.67%/month. The average interest rate for PCFs borrowers is higher at
1.56%/month. Meanwhile, MFIs clients must pay up interest rate up to
                                          59




1.41%/month. The reason for the high interest rate from MFIs is that since the loan
size is small, the MFIs charge the high rate to compensate the transaction cost.

       Figure 3.2 show that commercial banks (dominated by VBARD) and PCFs
seem to focus on households with medium and upper income level. Meanwhile,
VBSP mostly serves the medium or low-income households including the poor,
while the mission of MFIs is mostly to target the poor or low-income households.

3.2.3. Poverty reduction role of microcredit
       Table 3.4 present the result of living standard of the borrower before and
after borrowing. After borrowing, the middle living standard remains highest,
accounting 53.37%. Meanwhile, after borrowing, the percentage of the poor and
very poor groups reduce largely; particularly, the 31.64% are found to be poor
before borrowing, but only 16.61% after, and the 6.95% are found to be very poor
before borrowing, but only 1.25% after. As for the upper middle-income group, the
percentage increases remarkably from 7.37% before borrowing to 27.83% after.
Meanwhile, the percentage of wealth household does not increase much. Therefore,
it indicates that microcredit play a significant role in helping the borrowers escape
poverty, but there’s no impact on living standard of the wealthier borrowers. The
remaining of Table 3.4 reveal the change in living standards of borrowers for
specific bank/institutions.

    CHAPTER 4 – DETERMINANTS OF ACCESSIBILITY TO
                               MICROCREDIT
      This chapter presents the first objective, namely “Determinants of
Accessibility to Microcredit”, including three sections. The first two sections will
discuss about research methods, including estimation strategy and selection of
variables used for analysis. The second section describe data source, research
sample and some summary statistics. The third section will present estimated results
and discussions.


4.1. Research method
      Theoretical and empirical studies assume that rural financial market is
characterized by a high demand for credit (Swain, 2002; Kashuliza & Kydd, 1996).
In Isoto et al.’s (2016) research in rural Uganda, a theoretical model to demonstrate
the role of credit is developed under the assumption that individuals are credit
constrained. Since economic reforms in 1986, Vietnam’s economy, including rural
sector, has gained remarkable achievement. Thenceforth, with many emerging
opportunities, rural households have high demand for credit to finance their
production (Duong and Izumida, 2002). The fact that rural households are credit
constrained and their borrowings is limited can be explained by asymmetric
information, lack of collateral, or risk aversion (Boucher, Carter, & Guirkinger.,
2008; Islam & Maitra, 2012 cited in Isoto et al. 2016). On the basis of qualitative
research, this assumption may hold true for the case of Vietnam, especially the rural
poor. The demand for credit in rural area may be different across regions; however,
the in-depth interview with some credit officers and village leaders shows that the
number of households in need of credit is around 70% of population for the case of
Phuoc Tan Hung Commune (Chau Thanh District, Long An Province) or most of
rural residents for the case of An Quang Huu Commune (Tra Cu District, Tra Vinh
Province). Khoi et al. (2013) show that among borrowers in Mekong Delta River
region of Vietnam, 20.1 percent borrow from informal sources, 33.7 percent from
                                          62




formal sources and 46.2 percent from both sources, which indicate that many
households still borrow from informal sources. In Vietnam, there are 7.8 million
borrowers from microfinance institutions (MIX, 2014). Therefore, other households
may borrow from informal sources. Most of households need capital for investment
or consumption. In Khoi et al.’s (2013) research, only around 1 percent of the
research sample are credit-unconstrained, 15.5 percent are credit constrained
without loan, and 83.5 percent are borrowers.
       In what follows, this research assumes that rural households are generally
cash constrained. The borrowers are then defined as households who apply to
borrow and succeed in getting microfinance loan. The non-borrowers are cash-
constrained but do not apply to borrow or apply but fail to get the loans from
microcredit sources.


4.1.1. Estimation strategy
       Household’s accessibility to credit is defined as their ability to borrow from
different credit (Diagne & Zeller, 2001; Diagne, 1999 cited in Li et al., 2011a). As
discussed in the Section 2.2.3 and 2.3.1, model of accessibility to credit is
conceptualized by as a sequential two-stage lending process that is started at the
demand side, and then followed by supply side (Zeller, 1994; Li et al., 2011a; Khoi
et al., 2013). At the first stage of lending process, household i will decide to borrow
when expected utility from borrowing (denoted as UiB) is greater that from non-
borrowing (denoted as UiNB). In another expression, the household i will choose to
apply for a loan when 𝑈𝑖∗ = 𝑈𝑖𝐵 − 𝑈𝑖𝑁𝐵 > 0. Then, the lender will decide whether
to grant the loan. Based on theory and previous studies (Zeller, 1994; Duong &
Izumida, 2002; Li et al., 2011a; Khoi et al., 2013; Li et al., 2013), credit demand
and supply is affected by characteristics of the choices themselves, individuals (i.e.
household head), households, communes, and financial institutions.
                                             63




       Following Li et al. (2011a), Khoi et al. (2013), empirical of households’
accessibility to microcredit is expressed in a function of observed variables as
follows:
                               U i* =  ' X i +  i with Ui = 1 if U i*  0

                               Ui = 0 otherwise

       Where,
       U : Latent variable representing borrowing status (=1 if Borrow; 0
               otherwise).
       X      : Observable explanatory variables that affect accessibility to microcredit
       𝛽      : Coefficients of observable explanatory variables
       𝜀𝑖 : Error term.
       i      : Household i.
       Logit and Probit regression are two popular methods used for estimating the
determinants of accessibility to microcredit with discrete choice. Caliendo and
Kopeinig (2008) state that estimated results from these two models are quite similar.
This research employs logit model for analysis. Based on Ben-Akiva & Lerman
(1985), Train (2003) and Li et al. (2011), the model is expressed as follows:
                                               1
                   Pr(Crit = 1) =                                                 (Eq.1)
                                    [1 − exp( +  X it )]

Where:
       Crit      : Accessibility to microcredit (=1 if borrow; 0 otherwise)
       Xit       : Observable explanatory variables
       i, t      : Household i at time t
       Pr        : Estimated probability of access to microcredit
       With a logit transformation, the estimated model becomes a linear function
of the explanatory variables. The linear function is written as follows:
                                               Pr 
                   log it[Pr(Crit = 1)] = log          =  +  X it             (Eq.2)
                                              1 − Pr] 
                                          64




       Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) using fixed effects (FE) in binary
choice models (Probit or Logit) may result in a large finite sample bias when T is
small (Greene, 2004). This bias reduces rapidly as T increases to three and more
(Greene, 2004). Moreover, fixed effects models will omit the time-invariant
variable, but these are determinants of interest in this research, such as gender, some
characteristics at commune level. For robustness check, this research objective
employs Fixed effects (FE), Random effects (RE) and Pooled OLS for empirical
analysis.
       Estimations from Probit or Logit only show the effect direction of the
variables, not the magnitude of impact. Therefore, marginal effect is conducted as
the post-estimation of Probit/ Logit model to show the magnitude of impact of each
variable on accessibility to microcredit program.
       In addition, this study also decomposes sample to different population groups
by poverty status for further investigation. This heterogenous check will provide
more information on the effects of the factors on accessibility to microcredit among
the poor and non-poor groups. The rational for this further investigation is that the
effect of observed factors may be heterogeneous, thus significant (positive or
negative) impacts cannot be concluded on average. For instance, Takahashi et al.
(2010) and Coleman (2006) investigate the role of microcredit on welfare. Their
findings show that with whole sample, no or some significant impacts of
microcredit are found on certain outcomes; however, when decomposing into poor
and non-poor, the impacts have some change, that is, some remain similar to whole
samples while some become significant. Following this approach, this study divides
the sample to poor and non-poor for further investigation. As presented in Section
2.2.2 and 2.2.3, the poor are more credit constrained than the non-poor as well as
have more difficulties in accessing to credit. Therefore, the determinants of the
poor’s accessibility to microcredit may be different from those of the non-poor.

       The contribution of this objective is that it employs longitudinal data with
different econometric models such as RE, FE and Pooled OLS for estimation of
                                          65




determinants of accessibility to microcredit. To the best of my knowledge, very few
studies in the world and in Vietnam examine this issue using longitudinal data with
various models.


4.1.2. Selection of variables
4.1.2.1. Dependent variable
       The dependent variable in this objective is the accessibility to microcredit
which is also the key variable in this research. Microcredit, in this research, is
defined the small and collateral-free loans from formal sources that are used for
income-generating activities such as production or self-employment. As prescribed
in the Decision No. 306/QD-TTg of the Prime Minister, the maximum amount that
Vietnam Bank for Social Policy can grant the poor is 100 million dong. Moreover,
some studies in Vietnam specify the amount of microcredit no larger than 100
million dong (Khoi et al., 2013; Thanh, 2017; Dung & Thanh, 2017, Thanh &
Duong, 2017). On this basis, this research also limits the loan amount under 100
million dong to be considered as microcredit. The variable used for analysis is a
dummy, equal to 1 if household borrows from microcredit sources, and 0 otherwise.
       Appendix 4.1 shows microcredit variables used for analysis in the previous
empirical studies in the world and in Vietnam. It indicates that characteristics of
microcredit differ from research. Moreover, dependent on each type of methods or
the authors’ interest, measurement of microcredit variable used for analysis is also
different; in particular, some require/use binary, while some require/use continuous
variable. In this research, accessibility to microcredit is binary variable and equal to
1 if rural household has accessed microcredit and zero otherwise.


4.1.2.2. Explanatory Variables
       There is no firm theory on the selection of explanatory variables to be
incorporated into the model of determinants of accessibility to credit sources,
including formal or informal. The empirical evidences document that factors
                                          66




affecting households’ probability of accessing microcredit may includes
characteristics at household head level, household level, region level and
institutional level (Duong and Izumida, 2002; Li et al, 2011a; Khoi et al., 2013; Li
et al., 2013).
       Another important issue is that OLS estimation using Eq. (2) may be biased
if the variables on the right-hand side of the model are endogenous. Therefore, in
order to avoid endogenous selection bias due to omitted variables, this study
attempts to include in the model as many relevant explanatory variables as possible.
       On the basis of literature review in Section 2.3.1 and data availability, this
research selects the explanatory variables to include in the research model. Table
4.1 presents the variables used for analysis of this objective and their expected sign
(See Appendix 4.2 for detailed description). These variables are assumed to be
exogenous in previous empirical studies. Therefore, this research also assumes that
these variables are exogenous in order that OLS estimation using Eq. (2) is valid.
       As stated in Section 2.2.2, asymmetric may affect the accessibility to
microcredit of the target client. Since the target clients of the poor are normally the
poor and women, this research objective will examine whether the poor and female
household heads have better accessibility to microcredit. The theory depth of
outreach and cost of outreach to users presented in Section 2.2.4 are also referred
for further explanation.
       Most of empirical studies have not included in the model social capital
variable. Li et al. (2013) state that social capital is an important variable in
explaining the accessibility to credit. Social capital represents network, and with
more and better network, households are more likely to access to credit. In addition,
social capital is possibly correlated with other credit, saving or poverty status on the
right-hand side of the models, thus the lack of social capital may cause endogeneity
bias due to omitted variables. Therefore, this research objective introduces social
capital in the model to reduce endogeneity bias.

4.1.3. Research hypotheses
       On the basis of variables selected to incorporated in the research model in
Section 4.1.2.2 and literature review in Section 2.2.1, the research hypotheses are
stated as follow
       H1a: Education level of household head is expected to have positive sign.
Household heads with more education tend to possess more and better skills and be
more exposed to risk, thenceforth they are more likely to use credit for agricultural
                                           68




production or non-farm activities. With higher education, households are easier to
process and complete the legal documents and procedure when applying for
borrowing from microcredit sources.
       H1b: Age, a good proxy for experience, is hypothesized to have positive
sign, thereby indicated that probability of accessing microcredit increases with age.
       H1c: Marital status is also expected to have positive sign, which implies that
married household heads are more likely to access to microcredit sources than their
non-married counterparts (single, widow, divorced).
       H1d & H1e: Targeting clients of microcredit programs are normally the
poor. Thenceforth, Poverty status and Poor Commune is expected to have positive
relationship with loan acceptance.
       H1f: Targeting clients of microcredit are normally women. Thenceforth,
gender (=1 if male) is expected to have negative relationship with accessibility to
microcredit.
       H1g: Ethnicity is expected to have negative association with access to credit,
which indicates that microcredit is designed to serve the non-Kinh minority ethnic.
       H1h: Non-microcredit is hypothesized to have negative effect since
households are less likely to have access to microcredit sources if they borrow from
any other sources. Similarly, saving is expected to be negatively associated with
households’ accessibility to microcredit, which implies that saving is substitution
source for credit rather than a good collateral.
       H1i & H1j: Agricultural land and residential land are expected to have
positive effect on probability of accessing microcredit sources. Land is considered
as not only a good collateral asset but households’ capacity of agricultural
production as well. In this research, agricultural land is defined by area of
agricultural land possessed or managed or rented by rural households.
       H1k, H1k, H1m & H1n: Household size, agricultural labors, wage labor
and non-farm labor are expected to have positive relationship with accessibility to
microcredit since these variables denote intra-household labor resource. In addition,
                                         69




more labor involved in agricultural, wage or non-farm activities may imply higher
potential income, thereby resulting in higher capacity of repayment.
       H1o: Dependency ratio is hypothesized to be negatively associated with
households’ likelihood of accessing microcredit. More dependent may imply less
capacity of repayment due to lower potential income.
       H1p: Social capital is expected to have positive association with
accessibility. Social capital may reduce transaction cost incurred by both borrower
and monitoring cost by lender, which thereby increases accessibility to microcredit.
       H1q: Market is hypothesized to have positive effect. That is, if there is a
market in the commune where households reside, their probability of accessing
microcredit will increase. Market represents the development level of commune.
Moreover, it is a place where households can start their self-employment or sell
their agricultural products, thenceforth they may generate income for repayment.
       H1s: Distance to main road, a proxy for less advantaged location, is
hypothesized to be positively associated with accessibility to microcredit sources.


4.2. Research data
4.2.1. Data source
       This objective is analyzed using the data from Vietnam Access to Resource
Household Survey (VARHS) in 2012 and 2014. VARHS are conducted under the
cooperation of the Central Institute for Economic Management (CIEM), Ministry of
Planning and Investment (MPI), the Center for Agricultural Policy (CAP), Institute
of Labor Science and Social Affairs (ILSSA), Ministry of labor - Invalids and social
affairs (MOLISA); the Development Economics Research Group (DERG), the
University of Copenhagen; and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (DANIDA).
       Vietnam Access to Resource Household Survey (VARHS) is a large-scale
survey. This survey collects data from rural households in 47 communes located in
12 provinces in Vietnam, including Ha Tay, Lao Cai, Phu Tho, Lai Chau, Dien
Bien, Nghe An, Quang Nam, Khanh Hoa, Dak Lak, Dak Nong, Lam Dong and
                                        70




Long An. These 12 provinces represent 7 socio-economic regions in Vietnam,
including Red River Delta, North East, North West, North Central, South Central
Coast, Central Highlands and Mekong River Delta.
       VARHS survey provides detailed information about a wide range of
important demographic, economic and social characteristics of the farm households,
such as on farm- and farmer-specific attributes, resources endowment, agricultural
inputs and outputs, economic activities and welfare, savings and borrowings etc.


4.2.2. Research sample
       The VARHS 2012 include more than 3700 households, of those, most of
households are interviewed between June and July 2012, while some are
interviewed in August 2012. The VARHS 2014 include more than 3,648
households, of those, most of households are interviewed in the months of June and
July 2014, and some in May 2014. From more than 3,700 households survey in
2012, 3,644 households are re-interviewed in 2014. In order to create a balance
panel data, some observations with missing data are dropped out of the research
sample. The final sample used for estimation are 7,088 observations, including
3,544 households each survey.

4.2.3. Descriptive statistics
       Table 4.2 and Appendix 4.3 reports the loans obtained by households in this
research. For the case of pooled sample, the number of households granted with
loans is 2654, accounting for 37.44%. The number of borrowers tend to reduce over
time while the average amount increases from 2012 to 2014, which indicates that
credit provider seems to give priority to the amount of each loan rather than the
number of loans. This trend is similar for the case of microcredit and loan form
production (formal or informal). However, for the case of microcredit and informal
loan for consumption, there is an inverse trend; that is, the number of borrowers
tend to increase but the loan amount reduces over time. For the case of formal loan
                                        71




for consumption, both number of borrowers and loan amount tend to increase over
time. Among 2654 borrowers, there are 1908 borrowers from formal sources and
967 from informal sources, which indicates that some households borrow from both
sources. The total amount of informal loan imply that informal credit sector still
plays a significant role in rural financial market in Vietnam. This information is
similar to Barslund and Tarp’s (2008) research in Vietnam, in which find that credit
informal sector co-exists with formal sector and accounting for about one-third of
all loans. The explanation is that the rural poor households still rely on informal
networks and relatives.
      885 households are found to borrow from microcredit sources and of those,
there are 572 borrowers in 2012 and 313 borrowers in 2014. Meanwhile, there are
1,896 borrowers from other non-microcredit sources, and of those 922 borrowers in
2012 and 974 borrowers in 2014. The results on number of borrowers from any
source, microcredit and non-microcredit sources indicate that some households
borrow from both sources. This study focuses on microcredit only. Similarly, the
results on number of households borrowing from formal or informal sources show
that some households have access to both sources.

       Appendix 4.3 provides further details on loans obtained by the poor and the
non-poor. The statistics show that among microcredit and non-microcredit
borrowers, the non-poor account for higher proportion than the poor.
       Table 4.3 presents summary statistics on means for continuous variables and
proportions for discrete variables for whole sample, microcredit borrower and non-
borrowers in surveys of 2012, 2014 and pooled sample


4.3. Results and discussions
       Table 4.4 shows the estimated results of determinants of accessibility to
microcredit for the whole sample using fixed effects (FE), random effects (RE), and
Pooled OLS. LR test of Rho show that RE is favorable than Pooled OLS. The
results from Hausman test show that FE is superior to RE. However, Maximum
likelihood estimation using FE in using logit may cause large finite sample bias
when T is small (Greene, 2004). In this study, T equal 2; thus, the estimates using
FE may be biased due to reduced sample size. In fact, the results indicates that the
number of observations actually used for FE estimation reduces from 7088 to 1402.
It indicates that a large number of households are dropped out due to no within-
individual variation (all positive or all negative outcomes). Therefore, the
interpretations in upcoming section will use the estimated results from RE model.
More particularly, the marginal effects will be used to interpret the effect magnitude
of each variables.
       Non-microcredit is found to have negative impact on accessibility to
microcredit sources and be significant. It indicates that microcredit and non-
microcredit are substitute credit sources. This finding is similar to a research in
China by Li et al. (2011a), but contrast to the case in Vietnam by Khoi et al. (2013).
Non-microcredit include credit from informal sector. Informal sectors meet the
demand of households who are rejected from formal credit providers (including
microcredit). Moreover, some households prefer to borrow from informal sources
due to flexible lending schemes, simple procedure or promptitude (Li et al., 2011a).
                                           74




Thenceforth, the existence of informal sector may be indispensable and inevitable
due to insufficient credit supply or credit rationing from formal credit sources,
including microcredit (Li et al., 2011),
       Similar to the variable non-microcredit, saving also leads to a decrease in
households’ access to microcredit and this effect is statistically significant. This
estimated result is similar to empirical studies by Fenwick and Lyne (1998) in South
Africa, Quach and Mullineux (2007) in rural Vietnam, and Li et al. (2011a) in rural
China, who finds that saving has inverse relationship with access to credit sources.
Therefore, it implies that saving is not a collateral source for credit providers but a
substitution source of credit (Fenwick and Lyne, 1998).
       Poverty status is positively associated with accessibility of microcredit and
significant. This indicates that the microcredit program truly serves the rural poor.
This is in accordance with the mission of microcredit program. This finding is
consistent with a research in Vietnam by Khoi et al. (2013), who conclude that rural
households having poor certificate are more likely to borrow from microcredit.
Similar to Poverty status, National Target Program is another proxy variable for
poverty status at commune level. This variable is also positively associated with
accessibility to microcredit. This may indicate that communes with difficult
condition and low living standard are the main target of microcredit programs.
       Land is traditionally considered as a good collateral asset (Binswanger &
Rosenzweig 1986) when households borrow from any credit sources. The
estimation results show that agricultural land is positively associated with
accessibility to microcredit. This finding is similar to empirical study by Quach and
Mullineux (2007) in rural Vietnam. Meanwhile, residential land has no effect on
accessibility to microcredit. One of characteristics of microcredit is collateral-free.
This may give a plausible explanation for the fact that residential land plays no role
in facilitating households’ accessibility to microcredit. However, agricultural land
has significant effect since in addition to function as a collateral asset, it also
implies households’ capacity of production.

      Regarding variables denoting households labor resources, Dependency Ratio
has negative effect on accessibility to microcredit, which implies that household
with more dependent members has lower probability of borrowing from microcredit
source. A plausible explanation is that these households tend to have low capacity
of repayment, due to the fact that they may have less potential income per capita (Li
et al., 2011a). Household Size has positive effect on accessibility to microcredit.
More members may indicate more potential labors and higher future expected
income, thereby increasing the likelihood of repayment.
      The coefficient of variable Age of household head is negative and
significant, suggesting that age decreases the probability of access to microcredit.
This finding is contrary to Khoi et al. (2013) for the case of Vietnam and Zeller
(1994) for the case of Madagascar, who conclude that older farmer is more likely to
access microcredit due to their more a higher commitment of repayment (Phan et
al., 2013). Social capital significantly increases the likelihood of accessing
microcredit. As noted in Section 4.1.2, social capital is represented by number of
organizations of which household is a member. This result may be similar to a
research in Indonesia by Okten and Osili (2004), who find the role of family and
community in improving probability of loan approval.
      Some regional dummies are significant, including North West, South
Central Coast and Central Highlands. It indicates that households in these regions
are more (Central Highlands) or less (North West, South Central Coast) likely to
access to microcredit than those in Mekong Delta River.
      As presented in Section 4.1.1, this study decomposes the sample to poor and
non-poor groups for further investigation. Table 4.5 shows the estimated results of
determinants of accessibility to microcredit for the non-poor. LR test of Rho shows
that RE is better than Pooled OLS, while the Hausman test shows that FE is
superior to RE. However, the number of observations in FE reduce largely from
4,910 to 894. Therefore, the interpretations will use the estimates from RE model.
The estimated results are the same as those of the whole sample, except for
                                         77




Distance and Market. The result shows that Distance is positively associated with
accessibility to microcredi. It indicates that farmers living far away from main road
are more likely to access microcredit sources. Households in remote area normally
encounter difficulties and benefit less from the infrastructure of the commune, and
thereby may become target clients of microcredit program. The coefficient of
variable Market is significantly negative, which indicates that households residing
in communes with market have lower probability of accessing microcredit.
       Table 4.6 shows the estimated results for the poor sample. LR test of Rho
shows that it is not necessary to use RE, as Pooled OLS is also sufficient, and yields
the similar results as RE. The results from Hausman test show that FE is superior to
RE. However, the research sample reduce largely from 2,178 to 508 when FE is
applied, thus the estimates may be biased. Therefore, the interpretation will use the
estimated results from Pooled OLS. The estimates show that there are some changes
in the estimated results of some variables. Such variables as Non-microcredit, Age
of Household Head, Household Size, Dependency Ratio, Social Capital and Poor
Commune have the same effect on households’ accessibility to microcredit as the
case of whole sample. Some variables turn from statistical significance to
insignificance, and vice versa. It is noted that education become significantly
significant in the poor sample, which indicates that household head with higher
education level will be more accessible to microcredit.
       Education of household head turns to have positive effect, which indicates
that the poor households’ probability of accessibility to microcredit increase with
education. This finding is similar to empirical studies by Quach and Mullineux
(2007), and Li et al. (2011a). In this research, the average of schooling years of
household heads is 6 years, of which that of the poor sample is around 4 years and
that of the non-poor sample is around 7 years. Thenceforth, it implies that the
education level of the poor is low and the household heads, on average, have not
completed primary school education. Therefore, for the case of poor sample,
education becomes an important factor which affects the households’ accessibility
                                         78




to microcredit. Household heads with higher education tend to possess more
knowledge or skills and be more exposed to risks, thereby increasing their demand
for more credit for production or self-employment (Li et al., 2011a). This finding
may be consistent with Li et al. (2011a), who conclude that farmers with completion
of secondary school education or less are more likely to access microcredit than
their uneducated counterparts.
       Compared to whole and non-poor sample, Saving becomes insignificant. It is
possibly explained by the fact that the poor households seem to have no or very
little amount of saving. Therefore, Saving tends to have insignificant impact on
accessibility to microcredit. Similarly, agricultural land turns to be statistically
insignificant for the case of the poor households. The rural poor may be landless
farmers or small landholders, and thereby it may make no or little difference in the
amount of agricultural land possessed among them. Therefore, agricultural land
plays no role in explaining poor households’ accessibility to microcredit. Moreover,
agricultural land in this research is defined as area of land used by households for
agricultural activities, and these plots may be owned, borrowed or rented by
households. Accordingly, this may explain why agricultural land has no significant
effect for the poor.
       Regarding regional dummies, some variables are statistically significant for
the whole sample. However, the results for the case of poor sample show there is
only difference between Central Highlands and Mekong Delta in terms of
households’ access to microcredit.
       In-depth interview of some rural households reveals other factors that may
affect their accessibility to formal credit. Some farmers, especially the ethnic
minority, report that loan procedure is quite complicated, which inhibit them from
access to the loan. Some credit group leaders confirm that other important factors
that may decide whether households will be granted with the loan, including: (1)
whether farmers have a clear production or business plan; (2) whether their credit
history is good or bad; and (3) whether they are serious and devoted to their work.

        CHAPTER 5 – MICROCREDIT AND ADOPTION OF
                      IMPROVED RICE VARIETIES
       This chapter presents the second objective, namely “Microcredit and
Adoption of Improved Varieties”, including three sections. The first section
introduces about research methods. The next section describes data used for
analysis. The final section discusses estimated results.


5.1. Research method
5.1.1. Estimation strategy
       Adoption decision of households depends upon the household-specific or
farm-specific characteristics; therefore, the farming households' decision on
whether to adopt a new technology is self-selection but not random-assignment
(Becerril & Abudulai, 2010). Let UiA be the farmer i's utility derived from adoption
of new agricultural input and UiN be their utility derived from non-adoption.
Farmers will decide to adopt the modern varieties when 𝑈𝑖∗ = 𝑈𝑖𝐴 − 𝑈𝑖𝑁 > 0.
However, the farmer's utility from adoption the new technology is un-observed.
Following Becerril and Abdulai (2010), Ali and Abdulai (2010), de Janvry et al.
(2010), Kassie et al. (2011), Asfaw et al. (2011), and Ghimire et al. (2015), the
adoption decision can be modeled using a random utility framework. The
framework is expressed in a function of observed variables as follows:
                             U i* =  ' X i +  i with Ui = 1 if U i*  0

                             Ui = 0 otherwise
       Where, Ui denotes latent variable representing adoption (1= Adopt; 0
otherwise). X denotes observable variables that affect the adoption decision. β are
the parameter vectors. 𝜀𝑖 denotes error term. i denotes the ith farmer.
       In this research sample, there are many farmers without adopting the
improved rice varieties while other farmers have different level of adoption. In other
words, the variable of adoption equals zero when the farmers do not adopt the
                                          82




improved varieties, and if the farm households decide to adopt, this variable takes
the positive continuous value. Therefore, it may be challenged in finding an
appropriate model to investigate the demand for the improved varieties. In this case,
an application of Tobit or Double-Hurdle is appropriate (Mason et al., 2013). del
Saz-Salazar & Rausell-Köster (2008) state that in order to solve the problem of
answers equal zero (that is, non-adopters), it is appropriate to apply Double-Hurdle
(DH) model.
          Technology adoption may entail a two-stage decision, including whether to
adopt and then how much to adopt (Tambo & Abdoulaye, 2012, Gebremedhin &
Swinton 2003). These decisions can be jointly or separately determined.
          Tobit model may be appropriate when these decisions are simultaneously
determined. That is, Tobit model assumes that the decision on whether or not to
adopt and decision on intensity of adoption are simultaneously made. Double-
Hurdle model is more suitable when the two-stage decisions are made separately
(Tambo and Abdoulaye, 2012). Double-Hurdle model assumes that these two-stage
decisions are made separately. In order word, the decision on whether to adopt
precede the intensity of adoption (Asfaw et al., 2011).
          Double-Hurdle or Two-Step Model was initiated by Cragg (1971). Some
studies have employed Double-Hurdle model to investigate the farmers’ decision on
adoption of modern varieties (Langyintuo & Mungima, 2008; Simtowe & Zeller,
2006; Teklewold et al., 2006; Tambo & Abdoulaye, 2012).
          By following Blundell and Meghir (1987), Detre et al. (2010), Tambo and
Abdoulaye (2011), the functions of Double-Hurdle model are written as follows:
U i* =   X i +  i                       First hurdle or First Stage
                                           (Decision whether to adopt or not)   (Eq.1)
Ui = 1 if U i*  0 and Ui = 0 otherwise


Yi* =  Zi +  i
                                               Second hurdle or Second Stage
Yi = Yi * if Yi*  0 and U i*  0              (Decision on adoption level)     (Eq.2)
                                         83




Yi = 0 otherwise
        Where U, as above-denoted, is the latent variable representing the farmer’s
decision on whether to adopt and equals 1 if the farm households adopt and 0
otherwise. Y is the latent variable that denotes the farmer’ decision on intensity of
adoption and is measured, in this research, using the farmer’s expenditure on the
improved rice varieties.
       X and Z are the explanatory observable variables in the first stage and the
second stage of Double-Hurdle, respectively. Literature documents that the
explanatory variables used in the two stages may be the same (Simtowe & Zeller;
2006; del Saz-Salazar & Rausell-Köster, 2008; Detre et al.; 2011; Tambo &
Abdoulaye; 2012) or different (Teklewold et al., 2006; Ricker-Gilbert et al., 2011;
Asfaw et al., 2011). This research investigates the farmers’ two-stage decisions
using the same explanatory variables, which means X and Z will be the same set of
variables.
       In the first stage, Probit or Logit may be employed for investigate the
probability of adoption (Langyintuo & Mungima, 2008). For the second stage,
several estimation techniques are suggested to determine the decision on the
adoption intensity, including Truncated Regression (Teklewold et al., 2006; Ricker-
Gilbert et al., 2011; Tambo & Abdoulaye; 2012; Saz-Salazar & Rausell-Köster,
2008; Detre et al.; 2011), OLS Regression (Cragg, 1966; Simtowe & Zeller; 2006),
or Tobit (Newman et al., 2003; Blundell & Meghir, 1987). This study applies Probit
and Truncated Regression to examine the farmers’ decisions at the first and second
stages, respectively.
       This study presents both DH and Tobit models to make comparison, and
thereby determines which model best fits the data used for analysis. The likelihood
ratio (LR) test will be applied to investigate whether farmers make adoption
decisions jointly or separately. The likelihood ratio test makes comparison of the
log-likelihood values from the DH and Tobit models (Wooldridge 2002). Following
Goodwin et al., (1993), del Saz-Salazar & Rausell-Köster (2008), Tambo &
                                          84




Abdoulaye (2012), a likelihood ratio (LR) test will be employed using the following
equation:
                                    λ = −2(LLT − LLP − LTR)
       where LLT, LLP and LLTR denote the log-likelihood values for the Tobit,
Probit and Truncated models respectively. λ is a LR statistic value with chi square
distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the number of explanatory variables.
The value λ is estimated under the null hypothesis that the Tobit model is more
appropriate than the DH model. An assumption of LR test is that the same set of
explanatory variables is included in Tobit, Probit and Truncated model. Therefore,
these three equations in this research, as noted above, are estimated using the same
explanatory variable to examine the determinants of farmers’ decision on adoption
of the modern varieties in all three equations. If value λ is greater than Chi-square
critical value, the null hypothesis is rejected, and thereby the DH model is superior
to Tobit model. However, if the null hypothesis is not rejected, the Tobit is better fit
data than the DH model.
       Before examining the role of microcredit in fostering the farmers’ decision
on whether to adopt and how much to adopt the improved rice varieties using
Probit, truncated or Tobit, it is important to know whether microcredit is exogenous
in the model. Since this research uses observational and not experimental study, the
estimation using OLS method may result in endogeneity bias due to the fact that
accessibility to microcredit is not randomly assigned, but self-selection. There are
potentially heterogeneities that may affect both accessibility to microcredit and the
adoption of modern varieties. The fact that accessibility to microcredit may be
correlated with error term violates the OLS assumption, thus makes the OLS
estimates bias. A common method of controlling for this endogeneity bias is to use
instrumental variable (IV). Therefore, this research also uses IV 2SLS to treat
endogeneity of microcredit. The variables used as instruments are presented in
Section 5.3.
                                          85




       In double-hurdle models, differently from Heckman selection model
(Heckman, 1979), in which zeros are not affected by the purchasing decision,
observed zero expenditures are the result of either adoption or purchasing decisions
and potential adopters may have zero expenditure on purchasing improved varieties
(Aristei & Pieroni, 2008). For robustness check, this research also investigates the
impact of microcredit on adoption of improved rice varieties using Heckman model.
       Based on literature review in Section 2.3.2, when examining the whether
farmers’ decision on whether to adopt and how much are made separately or jointly
at the same time, most of studies employ cross-sectional data to investigate this
issue. Therefore, this research objective aims to examine farmers’ decision use
cross-sectional data only.
       In addition, this study also divides sample to different population groups by
poverty status for further investigation. As discussed in Section 4.1.1, the estimates
of an explanatory variable on dependent variable may be varied among different
population groups (Takahashi et al., 2010; Coleman 2006). Moreover, as discussed
in Section 2.2.2 and 2.2.3, the poor are more credit constrained than the non-poor
as well as have more difficulties in accessing to credit. Also, as presented in Section
2.2.5, farmers’ behavior under credit constraint and unconstraint may be different.
Therefore, the effects of microcredit on adoption decisions of the poor and non-poor
farmers may be different.


5.1.2. Selection of variables
5.1.2.1. Dependent variables
       For this objective, the first Hurdle classifies adopters as farm households
who plant the at least one type of improved rice varieties while non-adopters are the
farmers who cultivate the old local varieties. In the second Hurdle, literature
document some variables to reflect the adoption level such as expense, land area or
quantity used for cultivating these modern varieties (Shiferaw et al, 2008; Tambo &
Abdoulaye, 2012; Asfaw et al., 2011; Mason & Smale, 2013). On the basis of
                                           86




availability of data, expenditure for purchasing improved rice varieties is used to
measure the level of adoption. Definition and descriptive statistics of these two
variables are presented in Table 5.1 and 5.2.

5.1.2.2. Independent variables
       The main explanatory variable is microcredit. As discussed in the detailed at
Section 4.1.2.1 and Section 4.2.3, microcredit is defined as a collateral-free and
small loan (less than 100 million dong) from formal sources that are used for the
purpose of production or business.
       In addition to microcredit variable, this research includes some other control
variables that may have effect on adoption of improved rice varieties. Regarding
selection of explanatory variables, Langyintuo and Mungima (2008) state that there
is no firm theory on which variables should be incorporated in the double-hurdle
model when investigating the determinants of adopting improved varieties.
Variables that are typically used in the technology adoption model include: (1)
farmer-specific characteristics; (2) farm -specific characteristics, (3) technology
characteristics or farmers' perception about the technology. In order to avoid
endogenous selection bias due to omitted variables that may affect accessibility to
microcredit, this study attempts to include in the model as relevant explanatory
variables as possible. On the basis of literature review in Section 2.3.2 and
Appendix 2.2 and availability of data, the control variables that may affect adoption
of improved rice varieties are selected (see Appendix 5.12 for details). Descriptive
statistics of these variables are presented in Table 5.2.

5.1.3. Research hypotheses
       On the basis of variables in the research model in Section 5.1.2 and literature
review in Section 2.2.2, the research hypotheses are stated as follow:
       H2a: Microcredit has significant and positive effect on probability of
adopting improved rice varieties.
       H2b: Microcredit has significant and positive effects on level of adopting
improved rice varieties. In other words, microcredit is expected to significantly
increase expenditure for purchasing improved varieties.
       Since this research objective focuses on examining the role of microcredit,
the hypotheses of other control variables will be not stated here in the interest of
brevity. The hypotheses of these variables are presented in Appendix 5.12.


5.2. Research data
5.2.1. Data source
       This objective is analyzed using the data from Vietnam Access to Resource
Household Survey (VARHS) in 2014. As discussed in Section 4.2.1, VARHS are
conducted under the cooperation of various organization, institution and university,
domestically and internationally.
       VARHS is a large-scale survey. This survey collects data from rural
households in 47 communes located in 12 provinces representing 7 socio-economic
regions in Vietnam. VARHS survey provides detailed information about on farm-
and farmer-specific attributes, resources endowment, agricultural inputs and
outputs, economic activities and welfare, savings and borrowings, etc.

5.2.2. Research sample
       As described in Section 4.2.2, the VARHS 2014 include more than 3,648
households, mainly interviewed in the months of June and July 2014. 3,644
households are re-interviewed from the survey in 2012. After dropping some
variables due to missing information, the final sample used for analysis is 3,544
                                         88




household in both surveys. Although this research objective only employs cross-
sectional data, the sample of 3,544 households in both years are still preferred for
empirical analysis instead of all households in the survey 2014 only.
       The research objective is to investigate the determinants of adopting
improved rice varieties. Accordingly, the farm households without rice cultivation
were omitted. Some households were also dropped out of the sample due to the
missing data or outlier values. The final sample observations used for analysis in
this research are 2,438 farm households from seven regions; of these, 1,971 adopt
the improved rice varieties and 467 are non-adopters.


5.2.3. Descriptive statistics
       Table 5.2 provides some information on adoption and expenditure for
improved rice varieties by borrowing status. On average, there are around 80.84
farmers cultivating these improved varieties and farmer will spend, on average,
about 1036.95 thousand VND on purchasing this agricultural input. The proportion
of adopters in borrowing group seem to be lower than that in non-borrowing group.
Borrowing and non-borrowing farmers will spend about 1118.5 and 1027.6
thousand VND on purchasing modern varieties.
       Table 5.3 shows that for the sample of rice farmers, there are around 10.3
percent of households with access to microcredit. The ration of credit borrowers in
adopting group seems to be lower than that in non-adopting groups.

5.3. Results and discussions
       As discussed in Section 5.1.1, the OLS estimation may result in endogeneity
bias due to the fact that accessibility to microcredit is self-selection. There are
potentially unobserved variables that may affect both accessibility to microcredit
and the adoption of improved rice varieties. A common method of treating this
endogeneity bias is instrumental variable (IV) approach. Empirical study on
microcredit by Khandker et al. (2010) and Islam & Maitra (2012) suggest a relevant
instrument to control for endogeneity are eligible households in program village.
Microcredit institutions in their studies typically provide loan to households with
less than half-acre land in the program village. Therefore, the authors use an
interaction variable between eligibility status (=1 if household is eligible, 0
otherwise) and program village (=1 if households reside in the program village, 0
otherwise) as an instrument. However, due to data limitation, the information on
“eligibility of households” is unavailable.
       The research by Nguyen (2008) suggests two instrumental variables
including commune poverty rate and distance from commune to the nearest banks,
which are available in the dataset. Therefore, commune poverty rate and distance
from commune to the nearest banks will be used as instruments to treat the
endogeneity of microcredit variables in this study. In addition, this research
objective also suggests another instrument, namely group support to access credit.
The feasibility of this variable, by argument, is that it may be correlated with
accessibility to microcredit, as with better support related to credit, the households
may be more accessible to microcredit. However, there is no potential mechanism
for the effect of group support to access credit on the adoption of improved
varieties.
       Table 5.4 and 5.5 present the estimates using IV 2SLS (see Appendices 5.1
and 5.2 for details). The first stage estimates and F-test in Table 5.4 show that the
instruments are relevant, however only group support to access credit has
                                                  91




significant effect. The estimates and F-test in the second stage show that microcredit
is exogenous. Therefore, it is not necessary to use IV 2SLS estimation with 3 IVs.

       However, since in the models using three IVs, commune poverty rate and
distance to nearest VBSP variables are not significant, and thereby it may affect the
results in the second stage. Therefore, Table 5.5 re-estimates the IV 2SLS model
using only one IV, namely group support to access credit. The estimates in both
stages yield same results as those in Table 5.4, and thereby it may be concluded that
microcredit is exogenous. Results from Table 5.4 and 5.5 indicate that it is not
necessary to use IV 2SLS; therefore, the results in the up-coming section of this
chapter use OLS estimations.
       Table 5.6 presents the estimated results using the Tobit model and the
double-hurdle model (Probit and Truncated). The value λ of 3735.4 exceeds Chi-
square critical value 54.78 at significant level of 1 percent, thereby rejecting the null
hypothesis that Tobit model is more appropriate than Double-Hurdle model. This
result indicates that farmers’ decisions on whether to adopt and how much to adopt
improved varieties are made separately. Therefore, in the upcoming section, the
interpretation will use the results from Double-Hurdle model.
       Before interpretation of the estimated results, it is noted that the parameters
in tables in this section only indicate effect direction, but not the magnitude
(marginal effects). Therefore, the large parameters in Truncated or Tobit models do
not imply the marginal effects on the dependent variables.
       Table 5.6 shows that microcredit plays no role in any of the two-stage
decisions of the farmers. The sign of coefficients shows that Microcredit appears to
reduce farmers’ probability of adoption but when farmers decide to adopt,
microcredit seem to increase their level of adoption of the improved varieties;
however, these effects are not statistically significant.

       Non-microcredit is also found to reduce farmer’s decision toward whether to
adopt improved varieties and this effect is significant at 5 percent level. Non-
microcredit includes credit for such expenditures as health, education, family events
and other general consumption. Households with non-microcredit may consider
consumption or investment in human capital (health and education) as the top
priorities, and thereby they are less likely to invest in new agricultural inputs. At the
second stage, non-microcredit appears to increase farmers’ adoption level, but this
effect is not statistically significant.
       Saving seems to have negative effect on farmers’ decision at the first stage
and positive effect on their decision at the second stage; however, neither of these
effects is statistically significant. Similarly, though the coefficients of remittance at
both stages show positive effects of remittance on farmers’ decisions, there is no
evidence to conclude these effects because the coefficients could not pass the
significance test.
       Microcredit, Non-microcredit, Remittance and Savings represent the
farmers’ access to cash, which may relax the farmers’ financial constraint as well as
to increase the farm households’ risk bearing. Thenceforth, they can afford the
expenditure for new agricultural technologies, thereby increasing their adoption
(Hardaker et al., 1997; Zeller et al., 1997; Diagne et al, 2000; Langyintuo &
Mungoma, 2008; Obisesan, 2015). As hypothesized, these variables are expected to
have positive relationship with the adoption decision. However, the results find that
these variables play no role in fostering the adopting decision.
       Poor households are found to have less likelihood of adoption, but when the
poor decided to adopt, their economic condition has no significant effect on
adoption level. The poor normally face the problem of financial constraints;
therefore, it may be difficult for them to change or expand their cultivation practice
because of the lack of funds, facilities or land.
       Regarding variables representing farmers’ wealth such as durable assets,
production assets, wage income and livestock, the results show that none of these
                                           95




variables has significant effect on farmers’ adoption level. Meanwhile, at the first
stage, the effects of these variables on farmers’ decision at the first stage are as
different as chalk and cheese. Durable assets are found to increase farmers’
probability of adoption. However, production assets have inverse effect on farmers’
likelihood of adoption, which is inconsistent with finding by Mohamed and Temu
(2008). Households with more durables assets may be less liquidity-constraints,
thenceforth, they tend to adopt riskier technology. A plausible explanation for the
negative effect of production assets is that these assets may be used for self-
employment activities or agricultural services rather than for agricultural
productions, especially rice production.
       Information variable has statistically significant impact on probability of
adoption with the expected sign. This finding is similar to some studies about
varieties adoption in African, such as modern chickpea varieties in Ethiopia (Asfaw
et al., 2011) and modern pigeon pea varieties in Tanzania (Shiferaw et al., 2008).
       Visit by extension staff is found to play a significant role in farmers’
decision on whether to adopt the modern varieties. The positive impact indicates the
importance and efficiency of agricultural extension staff. They are considered as a
core source of provision of information and technical supports related to the new
technologies, which thereby facilitates the farmers’ adoption decision. The result is
consistent with some findings in Africa (Manda, et.al., 2016; Tambo & Abdoulaye,
2012; Mohamed &Temu, 2008; Teklewold et al., 2006).
       Regarding variables that represent substitute activities for crop production,
Wage income, livestock and other crop is found to have no significant effect on
adopting decision at both stages, and Non-farm is proved to have negative impact
on adopting decision. Specifically, the effect of non-farm is significant at the first
stage and there is no evidence to conclude the effect of nonfarm on adopting
decision at the second stage. As above-discussed, wage, and non-farm activities
may be considered as substitute or supplementary activities for agricultural
activities. The findings in Table 5.6 may support the idea that non-farm is a
                                          96




substitution activity with agricultural production, specifically investment in new
agricultural inputs. Consistent with earlier works, the relationship between non-farm
activities and technology adoption can be negative because non-farm activities
divert time and effort away from agricultural activities, reducing investment in
technologies and the availability of labor (Manda et.al., 2016).
       The land variables such as Irrigated land or Cultivation land are found to
significantly affect the farm households’ decision on probability of adoption.
Irrigated land has positive effect on farmers’ decision at both stages and these
effects are significant at 5 percent level. Following the explanation by Fernandez-
Cornejo et al. (1994), irrigation and modern varieties may be considered as
complementary technologies, and irrigation may improve yields. Accordingly,
farmers with larger irrigated land will have more likelihood of adoption.
Meanwhile, the farming households with more Cultivation land in general are less
likely to adopt these varieties. A plausible reason could be that farm households
with less areas are of higher demand of adopting modern variable to improve their
rice productivity via intensification. Moreover, households with more land have
larger production scale, and thereby the change in cultivation practice induce higher
cost, especially when their land lack of irrigation systems.
       The estimates also confirms that Distance from markets affects farmers’
probability of adopting new agricultural inputs. As expected, farmers locating far
away from markets are less likely to adopt modern varieties. This could reflect the
transaction costs of purchasing inputs so that further away a farmer is from market,
the higher the transaction costs and consequently the lower the likelihood that they
would adopt new varieties (Manda et al., 2016). This result is also consistent with
some studies in Africa such as Langyintuo and Mungoma (2008) or Mason and
Smale (2013) for modern maize varieties, Tambo and Abdoulaye (2012) for drought
tolerant maize varieties. After farmers decide to adopt improved varieties, distance
seems to have no significant effect on their adoption level.
                                         97




      Information or assistance variable has statistically significant impact on
probability of adoption with the expected sign. The marginal effect shows that seed
information facilitates the farmers’ decision on whether to adopt the modern
varieties by 3.6 percentage points. This finding is similar to some studies about
varieties adoption in African, such as modern chickpea varieties in Ethiopia (Asfaw
et al., 2011) and modern pigeon pea varieties in Tanzania (Shiferaw et al., 2008).
However, information or assistance seems to have no significant effect on their
adoption level.
      Visit by extension staff is found to play a significant role in farmers’
decision on whether to adopt the modern varieties. As hypothesized, farming
households visited by agricultural extension staff increase their likelihood of
adoption. The positive impact indicates the importance and efficiency of
agricultural extension staff. They are considered as a core source of provision of
information and technical supports related to the new technologies, which thereby
facilitates the farmers’ adoption decision. The result is consistent with some
findings in Africa (Manda, et.al. 2016, Tambo & Abdoulaye, 2012, Teklewold et
al., 2006). However, extension visit has no impact on the farmers’ adoption level.
      Regarding household labor variables, Household size and Working-age
member are not statically significant in explaining farmers’ probability of adoption
of the MVs, but Agricultural labor has significant positive impact on the farmers’
decision adoption. The farm households with more labors actively involved in
agricultural production activities are able to facilitate their adoption of new
agricultural technologies. This result is consistent with the previous findings by
Fernandez-Cornejo et al. (1994). Meanwhile, at the second stage, Household size
and Agricultural labors have no effect on farmers’ decision, but number of
working-age members significantly increase their decision on how much to adopt.
      Ethnicity has positive effect on the farmers’ decision on whether to adopt the
modern varieties. Farmers of the main ethnicity normally have more advantages in
terms of language or socio-economic status, which may promote their adoption.
                                          98




       Regarding variables reflecting characteristics of household heads, education,
age and marital status and gender seem to have no significant impact farmers’
decisions toward whether and how much to adopt improve varieties. The estimated
results show that only marital status has significantly positive effect of adoption
level. That is, married household heads tend to have higher adoption level.
       Business support has no significant effect on farmers’ decision at both
stages. Organization, a proxy for social capital, has no impact on farmers’
probability of adoption but have significantly positive effect on their adoption level.
       National target program is found to have no significant impact on farmers’
probability of adoption. Meanwhile, households living these communes are found to
have less adoption level.
       Permanent Market is found to have significantly negative effect at the first
stage but turn to significantly positive at the second stage. A plausible explanation
is that farmers residing in the communes with permanent markets are easily to find
buyers (output markets). The farmers are rational and risk-adverse when making
decision on adoption of new agricultural inputs. Thenceforth, when they find easy
to access to output market, they tend to retain their old cultivation practice to
optimize their utility. However, when farmers decide to adopt new varieties,
permanent markets may help them to access to output and input markets easily.
       Agricultural development and Irrigation Programs have no significant
effect on farmers’ probability of adopting improved varieties. Meanwhile, at the
second stage, agricultural development program is found to increase farmers’
decision toward how much to adopt.
       Table 5.6 may indicate that there is no significant effect of microcredit on
adoption of new agricultural inputs. However, the cost of purchasing improved
varieties is actually negligible. Therefore, some households are able to purchase
these varieties whether they can access to microcredit or not. Thenceforth, the
significant effect of microcredit on adoption has not been found. Simtowe and
Zeller (2006) investigate the impact of credit on adoption of hybrid maize and find
                                          99




that credit increases the adoption for the credit-constrained households but has no
significant effect for the case of un-constrained households. Mohamed and Temu
(2008) find that credit has significantly positive effect on the adoption of
agricultural technologies for both credits constrained and unconstrained farmers,
and the positive effect is larger among credit-constrained households. It would be
necessary and interesting if its impact can be investigated among different
categories,   especially   credit/cash/liquidity   constrained    and    unconstrained
households, poor and non-poor households. Due to the available of data, this
research will investigate the impact of microcredit on adoption among households
categorized by poverty status.
       For further investigation of the role of microcredit on adoption of improved
varieties, this study also divides sample by poverty status. Table 5.7 presents the
estimated results for the case of the poor and the non-poor farmers. The values λ of
both cases exceed Chi-square critical value at significant level of 1 percent, thereby
rejecting the null hypothesis that Tobit model is more appropriate than Double-
Hurdle model. This result indicates that poor or non-poor farmers’ decisions on
whether to adopt and how much to adopt improved varieties are made separately.
       Table 5.7 reports the estimates for the poor and non-poor samples (see
Appendix 5.3 and 5.4 for full estimation). Similar to the whole sample, there is no
evidence to conclude the role of microcredit in explaining the poor or non-poor
farmers’ decisions on probability and level of adoption. For robustness check, this
research also applies Heckman model to investigate the impact of microcredit on
adoption of improved rice varieties (see Appendices 5.5 – 5.7).
       For further investigation, it is interesting to examine the interaction effect of
microcredit and other variables on decision of adoption of improved rice varieties.
Since adoption of improved varieties may incur high initial cost and require more
machine and equipment, it is expected that borrowers with more production assets
will have more probability and higher level of adoption. Therefore, interaction
between microcredit and production asset variables will be used for further analysis.
                                          100




Similar, borrowers with more accessibility to market, measured by distance to main
road and borrowers residing in commune with permanent markets, will also be more
likely to adopt improved varieties as well as spend more on purchasing the varieties.
Therefore, the interaction between microcredit and distance, microcredit and market
variables will also be used for further investigation. However, when such interaction
variables are included in the models, the effects are still insignificant, for the whole,
poor and non-poor samples, except the interaction of microcredit and production
assets reduce the intensity of adoption for the poor samples. In the interest of
brevity, these estimates are presented in Appendices 5.8 – 5.10.
       The above-discussion concludes that there is no role of microcredit in
fostering farmers’ decision on adopting improved varieties at both stages. However,
it is not the end of the story. As above-mentioned, investment in agriculture is risky
and takes time to get the return. Therefore, farmers may shift their job out of
agricultural production. For instance, farmers may use their loan to invest in non-
farm business. Another plausible explanation is that crop production is riskier than
livestock production since climate shocks (i.e. flood, drought) seem to affect crop
rather than livestock production (Vilhelm et al., 2015). As a result, microcredit
borrowers may choose to invest in rearing livestock rather than crop production.
       In this research, non-farm, livestock and other (non-rice) crop may be also
considered as good proxies of diversification of production activities, which may
indicate demand for resources (e.g. capital, land or labor). On the basis of this
understanding, these variables are expected to reduce the farmers’ decision on
adopting modern rice varieties due to limited labor resources, thereby resulting
labor substitution from rice production to other activities, for instance other
cultivars (Bandiera & Rasul, 2006). It is noteworthy that non-farm and livestock
have significantly negative impact on decision of farmers in both stages. Therefore,
this may cast some doubts that farmers may use their loan for other activities rather
than investment in new rice varieties. Moreover, to capture better and deeper
understanding about investment choice of rice farmers, it is essential to conduct
                                                101




some further estimations; that is, investigate the role of microcredit in facilitating
farmers’ decision on other investment portfolio. Therefore, the upcoming section
will examine the effect of microcredit on other investment activities.
         Table 5.8 (see Appendix 5.11 for details) finds that microcredit plays a
significant role in fostering farms’ decision on non-farm business and livestock, and
these effects are significant at 5 percent level. Meanwhile, similar to the case of
adoption of improved rice varieties, the result shows that microcredit has no
significant effect on other crop production. This finding is consistent with argument
of Vilhelm et al. (2015), who state that crop production is riskier than livestock.

CHAPTER 6 – IMPACT EVALUATION OF MICROCREDIT ON
                                    WELFARE
       This chapter presents the third objective, including three sections. The first
two sections will discuss about research methods and data used for analysis,
respectively. The third section present results and discussions.


6.1. Research method
6.1.1. Estimation strategy
       The objective of Impact evaluation of a program is to investigate the
difference in outcome between participation and non-participation in the programs.
However, in reality, we cannot observe one subject (household, person, etc.) at two
stages at the same time. That is, there is no household that can both participate and
non-participate in the programs. Impact evaluation methods will construct a
counterfactual to make comparison between participating group (Treatment) and
non-participating group (Control) with the most similar characteristics. Thenceforth,
it is possible to evaluate the impact of the programs on the outcome (welfare). This
research employs various techniques such as Propensity Score Matching (PSM),
Difference in Difference (DID), and PSM-DID.


6.1.1.1. Propensity Score Matching (PSM)
       PSM method was initiated by Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983), and then it is
developed in many studies by Becker and Ichino (2002), Dehejia and Wahba
(2002), Khandker et al., (2010). On the basis of impact evaluation using PSM, the
following steps should be conducted:
       Step 1: Conduct a Probit model of determinants on accessibility to
microcredit. The estimated probability of participation (or propensity score) of each
household is calculated from this model. The equation is written as follows:
                       Pr(Cri = 1) = 0 + 1Zi +  i                           (Eq.1)
                                           103




       Where, CRi denotes Accessibility to microcredit (1=Borrow; 0=Non-
borrow). Zi represents determinants of the accessibility to microcredit.
       Step 2: Specify the common support region. In this step, some observations
of control group may be dropped out because they have too high or two low
estimated probability. Also, in this step is the balancing test conducted to testify
whether, in each block, the average Propensity score and mean of X are not
different between treated units and control units.
       Step 3: Match each treated unit with one or some control units based on the
most similar propensity score to compare the outcomes. Various techniques of
matching may be applied such as Nearest-Neighbor Matching, Caliper (or Radius)
Matching, Stratification (or Interval) Matching, Kernel Matching.
       Step 4: Calculate average outcomes of all individual differences to capture
overall mean value that is considered as impact of microcredit program with respect
to the treated units. Average effect of Treatment for the Treated (ATT) can be
estimated using the following equation:
         ATT = E(Y1i – Y0i|CRi = 1) = E(Y1|CRi=1) – E(Y0i|CRi=1)               (Eq.2)
       Where, Y1i and Y0i represent outcomes of the treated and control, respectively.
       PSM has been a common method for policy researches including impact
evaluation of credit programs. PSM may to reduce the selection biases when
estimating the results. However, this method results in some limitations such as: (1)
PSM does not measure the difference in an outcome pre–post attendance in the
program overtime. (2) Hidden bias may still exist because PSM do not include
unobservable characteristics.

6.1.1.2. Difference in Difference (DID)
       Followed Lester (1946) and Khandker et al., (2010), the model using DID is
written as follows:
                Yit = 0 + 1T + 2Cr + 3T * Cr + 4 Zit +  it               (Eq.3)
                                            104




       Where, Yit denotes outcomes of households i at time t. Cr denotes treatment
status (1=Treated; 0=Untreated/ Control) or accessibility to microcredit (1=Borrow;
0=Non-borrower). T is time variable (1=Before treatment; 0=After treatment). Zit
represents other control variables. 𝜺𝒊𝒕 denotes error term.
       (𝛽̂0 ) and (𝛽̂0 + 𝛽̂1 ) are the mean outcomes of control group before and after
program, respectively. Meanwhile, (𝛽̂0 + 𝛽̂2 ) and (𝛽̂0 + 𝛽̂1 + 𝛽̂2 + 𝛽̂3 ) are the mean
outcome of treatment group before and after program, respectively. Accordingly,
(𝛽̂1 ) and (𝛽̂1 + 𝛽̂3 ) are the single differences between two comparison groups before
and after program, respectively. The DID estimate is the variation in outcome
between two comparison groups before and after program. Therefore, (𝛽̂3 ) is
estimated coefficients using DID.


6.1.1.3. PSM-DID
       PSM-DID is a combination of PSM and DID using panel data. Khandker et
al. (2010) state that PSM-DID can capture better results due to its reduction in
estimation bias. Based on PSM and DID methods, the PSM-DID includes main
steps as follows: (1) Calculation of propensity score; (2) Test balancing property
and specify common support; (3) DID combined with PSM to match treatment with
control group and estimate the impact of program.
       In addition to the matched-DID procedure suggested by Khandker et al.
(2010), this research employs matched-DID with command diff (using STATA)
developed by Villa (2016). Command diff combines DID estimation with kernel
matching (Heckman et al., 1997, 1998; Blundell and Dias, 2009; cited in Villa,
2016). The kernel weights are also incorporated to capture a kernel matching DID
treatment effect. Estimation using bootstrap with 50 replications is also applied. The
function is written as follows:
                 ATT = [Y1i | p(X i ), D = 1] - [Y0i | p(X i ), D = 0]         (Eq.4)
       Where, ∆Y1i and ∆Y0i denote the difference in outcomes of the treated and the
control across two periods, respectively.
                                        105




       In this research, matched-DID is more appropriate than standard DID
because microfinance at T=1 is not a “pure” treatment due to the fact that many
households use microcredit at T=0 and even other credits at both years. To satisfy
this condition of standard DID, all the households with any borrowings or at least
borrowing from microcredit in T=0 should be dropped out. In this case, it leads to
sample bias. Therefore, the application of DID may lead to bias. When calculation
propensity score for matching, the borrowing status at T=0 and other credit at both
years are taken into account. For instance, a treated and a control unit who both
borrow at baseline, may be used matched with each other. Moreover, they are quite
similar in terms of observed characteristics. Hence, when comparing the outcome, it
may reduce bias in estimation of the impact of microcredit. Moreover, the
estimation strategy used in this research is match-DID with kernel. However,
microcredit and non-microcredit at T=0 may encounter potential endogeneity due to
reverse causality. However, evaluation of microcredit with the ignorance of other
credit may lead to bias due to omitted variables. Therefore, this research includes
other credit in the probit model (first stage) and accept the potential endogeneity
due to reverse causality.
       Using panel data, this research objective may examine the Length of
outreach as discussed in Section 2.2.4. If the significant and positive effect of
microcredit is found, it may indicate the role of microcredit in enhancing long-term
welfare of households to some extend.


6.1.2. Selection of variables
       Due to nature of PSM-DID methods, three sets of variables will be used,
including accessibility to microcredit, determinants of accessibility to microcredit
(Variables for calculation of Propensity Score) and welfare variables.
6.1.2.1. Microcredit variable
       As discussed in the detailed at Section 4.1.2.1 and Section 4.2.3, microcredit
is defined as a collateral-free and small loan (less than 100 million dong), borrowed
                                         106




from formal sources and used for the purpose of production or business. (see Table
4.2 for descriptive statistics).
       As this study uses PMS-DID for impact evaluation, households with
microcredit at T=1 (Survey 2014 or follow-up) are defined as the treated, while
those without microcredit at T=1 are the control. Thenceforth, in this research,
treated group include 313 households while control group include 3,231
households. Table 4.2 show that many households access to microcredit at T=0.
Therefore, actually this study evaluates the impact of microcredit at T=1. In
addition, many households have access to non-microcredit at T=0 and/or T=1. As
discussed in Section 6.1.1.3, microfinance at T=1 is not a “pure” treatment, as many
households use microcredit at T=0 and even other credits at both waves. Therefore,
non-microcredit at T=0 and T=1 and microcredit at T=0 should be considered. This
research includes this information as the explanatory variables at the first stage (for
calculation of propensity score).


6.1.2.2. Variables for calculation of propensity score
       As discussed in Section 4.1.2.1, there is no firm theory on the selection of
variables to be incorporated into the model of determinants of accessibility to credit
sources, including formal or informal. The empirical evidences document that
factors affecting households’ probability of accessing microcredit may includes
characteristics at household head level, household level, region level and
institutional level (Duong & Izumida, 2002; Li et al, 2011a; Khoi et al., 2013; Li et
al., 2013; Thanh, 2017). On the basis of literature review in Section 2.3.1 and data
availability, the explanatory variables selected for calculating Propensity Score are
presented at Table 6.2 (See Appendix 4.1 for detailed description).

6.1.2.3. Welfare variables
       Based on the literature review in the Section 2.3.3 (Khandker et al., 2016),
Takahashi et al., 2010; Lensink & Pham, 2012; Quach, 2007, 2017; Thanh, 2017)
                                              107




and the availability of data, the outcome variables (dependent variables) used for
estimation the impact of microcredit are presented in Table 6.1 (see Appendix 6.1
for details). Statistical summary of these variables is presented in Appendix 6.3.

6.1.3. Research hypotheses
       On the basis of variables used for empirical analysis presented in Section
6.1.2 and literature review in Section 2.2.3, the research hypotheses are as follow:
       H3a: Microcredit has significant and positive effects on total output value
and income from earned sources.
       • H3a(i): Microcredit increases total output value and income from
           agriculture, and more particularly, from crop and livestock.
       • H3a(ii): Microcredit increases total output value and income from self-
           employment.
       • H3a(iii): Microcredit increases income from wage works.
                                         108




       • H3a(iv): Microcredit decreases total output value and income from
          common property resources.
       H3b: Microcredit has significant and positive effects on food consumption.
       • H3a(i): Microcredit increases agricultural food consumption.
       • H3a(ii): Microcredit increases non-agricultural food consumption.
       H3c: Microcredit has significant and positive effects on asset accumulation.
       • H3c(i): Microcredit increases accumulation of production assets.
       • H3c(ii): Microcredit increases accumulation of non-production assets.

6.2. Research data
6.2.1. Data source
       This objective is analyzed using the data from Vietnam Access to Resource
Household Survey (VARHS) in 2012 and 2014. As discussed in Section 4.2.1,
VARHS are conducted under the cooperation of        various organization, institution
and university, domestically and internationally.
       VARHS is a large-scale survey. This survey collects data from 3703 rural
households in 47 communes located in 12 provinces representing 7 socio-economic
regions in Vietnam. VARHS survey provides detailed information about on farm-
and farmer-specific attributes, resources endowment, agricultural inputs and
outputs, economic activities and welfare, savings and borrowings, etc.


6.2.2. Research sample
       As presented in Section 4.2.2, from more than 3,700 households survey in
2012, 3,644 households are re-interviewed in 2014. In order to create a balance
panel data, some observations with missing data are dropped out of the research
sample. The final sample used for estimation are 7,088 observations, including
3,544 households each survey.
                                           109




6.2.3. Descriptive statistics
       This section briefly discusses some descriptove statistics of key variables
(see Appendix 6.2 and 6.3 for details). Appendix 6.2 shows some statistical
summary on the characteristics of treatment and control group in the first wave
(baseline) and second wave (follow-up). There is significant difference between
treatment and control groups in terms of some characteristics. Regarding
microcredit variables, the statistics in the first wave indicates that at the base year
some treated and control households have access to microcredit. In particular, there
are around 29 percent of treated households and 15 percent of control households
that borrow from microcredit at the baseline, and the proportion in the treatments is
significantly higher than that in the control. As for variables used for calculation of
propensity score before and after matching, the statistics are presented in both
Appendix 6.2 an Table 6.3.
       Appendix 6.3 shows the mean of outcomes of both group as well as the
difference in outcomes between them at both time T=0 and T=1. For most of the
case, the borrowing group seem to have higher outcomes than their non-borrowing
counterparts, but only some of the difference in these indicators are statistically
significant. Most of average outcomes of both groups tend to increase over time.

6.3. Results and discussions
6.3.1. Propensity score and balancing test
       Table 6.2 briefly shows the main statistics in the first stage of PSM-DID (see
Appendix 6.4 for details). These results are used for the calculation of propensity
score. Khandker et al. (2010) suggests that the explanatory variables used for
estimating the probability of participation in a program should be in T=0. Therefore,
most of characteristics for estimating propensity score as T=0, except for Non-
microcredit, which include the information in T=0 and T=1. The estimations for the
first stage using probit, pscore or diff give the same results.
                                              110




        It is noteworthy that the determinants of accessibility to microcredit at T=1
include microcredit at T=0, and non-microcredit at T=0 and T=1. As stated in
Section 6.1.3.1, some households may borrow from microcredit sources at T=0 and
some households may access to other non-microcredit, which may lead to
estimation bias in the impact of microcredit at T=1. Therefore, these variables
should be incorporated in the model when estimation the propensity score.
        Regarding the multi-collinearity issue among these credit variables, it may
and may not exist theoretically. However, in this research, it does not exist, because
some households borrow from microcredit and non-microcredit at T=0, but do not
borrow at T=1, and vice versa. Therefore, microcredit at T=0, non-microcredit at
T=0 and T=1 do not fully predict the microcredit at T=1. Some households borrow
from both sources in T=0 and T=1, so microcredit and non-microcredit at T=0 and
T=1 may complete excluded or substituted each other. Moreover, Max VIF equals
to 4.32, which indicates that there is no multi-collinearity in this model.
        The results on common support regions specify that 148 households (using
diff command) or 151 households (using pscore) fall in off-support region. A further
investigation reports that difference using these commands is 8 households, which
is not large. Due to the second stage using diff to estimate the average impact of
microcredit, 3396 households in common support regions specified by diff will be
used for analysis.
        The result on balancing property test is satisfied. Table 6.7 shows that there
is no difference between treatment and control group after matching in terms of
observable characteristics.

6.3.2. Average impact of microcredit program
      Table 6.4 shows estimated results of the impact of microcredit on different
outcomes using three methods, including DID, and PSM-DID with and without
common support region.
      Total earned income (sum of agriculture, self-employment, common
property resources and wage) and total earned (non-wage) income seem to be
unchanged when households have access to microcredit. This finding is somewhat
similar to Takahashi et al. (2010) and Phan et al. (2014), who find no role of
                                             112




microcredit in improving total income, but contrary to Khandker and Koolwal
(2016) and Li et al. (2011b), who conclude that microcredit significantly increase
total earned income. However, the total production value (including and
excluding wage income) are found to increase when households can borrow from
microcredit sources. A plausible explanation is that households can simply raise
output via increasing input, but they can not gain the optimal input mix to improve
raise profits (Takahashi et al., 2010)

       Moreover, rural households may choose to diversify their income sources
and may concentrate in one main activity to do investment to optimize the return.
Moreover, microcredit may be effective in some sectors at disaggregate but not
aggregate level. Therefore, the next section will investigate the impact of
                                           113




microcredit on sub-categories of earned income sources, including agriculture, self-
employment and common property resources.
       Regarding agricultural sector, the results show that microcredit seems to
reduce income and increase total output value; however, neither of these effects
are statistically significant. This is quite consistent with Takahashi et al. (2009),
who find that microcredit does not improve sale or profit from agricultural
activities. More specifically, Takahashi et al.’s (2010) findings show that the effect
of microcredit on these outcomes is negative but statistically insignificant.
However, the findings in this research is different with Khandker and Faruqee’s
(2003) in Pakistan, in which conclude that the impact of credit on net value from
agricultural activities are significantly positive.
       However, Karlan and Goldberg (2007) state that microcredit may have no
impact on outcomes in short term, for instance, one years. Because some crops or
animals take time to gain the returns, it is better to divide agricultural sectors into
sub-sector to investigate in details.
       When investigating further on some sub-sectors of agricultural, microcredit
is found to have no impact on improvement of income and total output value from
raising animal, including livestock and aquaculture. That may be because some
livestock consume high investment in inputs (including Production loan interest
payment) but take time to gain returns (e.g. cow, buffalo). Thenceforth, the
borrowing households can not benefit from raising livestock in short term.
       Meanwhile, microcredit is found to reduce Income from crop, which is in
contrast with hypothesis. A plausible explanation for the decrease is that households
may shift their income-generating activities from crop production to other activities
such as raising livestock, aquaculture or self-employment when they borrow from
microcredit sources. This may be proved via no significant change in production
value when households have access to microcredit. Moreover, in order to improve
output from these products, new agricultural technology should be invested, which
incur great cost and high risk. Therefore, it may explain why microcredit,
                                         114




characterized by a small amount, plays no role in the improvement of income from
crop production. This is quite similar to the argument by Ho and Duc (2015) that
loan for the poor, for instance from VBSP, is still quite small in quantity, and
thereby it does not meet the demand for agricultural development. Another
plausible explanation is that crop production is riskier than livestock production
since climate shocks (i.e. flood, drought) seem to affect crop rather than livestock
production (Vilhelm et al., 2015). Thenceforth, the output from crop production
may not yield the high outputs. The findings are inconsistent with Khandker and
Koolwal’s (2016), who find that microcredit has no impact on crop income but
significantly positive effect on livestock income.
       Microcredit is found to have no impact on the difference in income from
common property resources; meanwhile it is found that microcredit borrowers
have lower total output value than the non-borrowers. The lower total output can
be simply explained by the less investment in inputs. It is somewhat in contrast with
the statement that credit finances deforestation (Ozorio de Almeida & Campari,
1995; Barbier & Burgess, 1996; Andersen, 1997; Pfaff 1997; cited in Angelsen &
Kaimowitz, 1999). Meanwhile, this finding is similar to the works by Godoy et al.
(1997) who find that families with credit may be less dependent on forest-based
activities or may choose to invest in off-farm activities. In other words, access to
credit may reduce exploitation of common property resources such as forest
clearance. The poor households seem to be greatly dependent on common property
resources such as pasture or forests (Jodha, 1992). In this research, a large
proportion of the rural poor (around 56.47%) depend on common property
resources for generate income.
       Kaimowitz (2003) states that most small-scale forestry activities in
developing countries are not legal or have unclear status promulgated by laws.
Those involved in such activities often work without permission in forests claimed
by governments or large landholders. With access to credit, the rural households,
especially the poor, may have more opportunities to get a more decent jobs, such as
                                        115




non-farm (Godoy et al., 1997), thereby being less dependent on common property
resources. Another explanation is that borrowers may commit to comply with
environmental requirement as a condition of rural credit (Assunçãoa et al., 2013).
      As strongly expected, microcredit has strong positive effect on self-
employment income and total output value. The result is quite consistent with
Khandker and Koolwal (2016), Dunn and Arbuckle (2001), Barnes et al. (2001a),
who find that microcredit has a positive impact on business revenue or income.
Microcredit is found to improve self-employment income since this may be the
original purpose of microcredit program. A research in Vietnam by Lensink and
Pham (2012) also find that microcredit truly improves self-employment profit.
      However, the estimates in this research are partly different with the findings
in Indonesia by Takahashi et al. (2010), who find that microcredit only have
improved sale of self-employment but have no impact of self-employment profit. In
Takahashi et al.’s (2010) research, the estimation is also conducted using PSM;
however, the time length between two surveys are short (one year). Thenceforth,
that may partly explain why microcredit only contribute to the expansion of self-
employment but not improve the profit from this activity within one year.
      It is not surprising that microcredit has no significant effect on households’
wage income. Literature document that there is no firm theory on the relationship
between microcredit and wage income activities in rural areas.
      The estimates from three methods are quite consistent in terms of sign of
coefficients. The statistical significances of most of coefficients are also the same
across methods excepts for the impact of microcredit on total output value from
common property resources and income from self-employment source. In particular,
the estimates using DID show that microcredit has no effect on these outcomes.
      Table 6.5 reports the results of the impact of microcredit on food
expenditure. The results show that food expenditure increases when households
can borrow from microcredit sources. This finding is consistent with Chen and
Snodgrass (2001), Khandker (2005), Quach and Mullineux (2007), and Quach
                                             116




(2017), who concludes that microcredit borrowers have higher food expenditure
than their non-borrowing counterparts. Barnes et al. (2001b) also confirm that
microcredit is positively associated with consumption of nutritious food (for
instance, meat, chicken, fish, milk) of extremely poor borrowers.

Note: *, ** and ***: Significant at 10%, 5% and 1%, respectively.


       The estimated results are quite consistent across three methods in terms of
sign, but the result using DID is not statistically significant. Further investigation
shows that microcredit has no effect on agricultural food but industrial food
expenditure. More particularly, microcredit improves households’ consumption on
industrial food. The results are consistent across three methods. The explanation is
that farmers may be self-sufficient in some agricultural products such as meat,
vegetable, fruit, etc., Moreover, farmers can barter their products in exchange for
agricultural products, or be given as gifts. Thenceforth, microcredit is found to have
no affect on consumption of agricultural food. Meanwhile, with access to
microcredit, the rural households can diversify their food expenditure toward
industrial food commodities that can not subsist (for instance, milk, beer, cake).
       Following the fourth mechanism in the analytical framework, if households
use microcredit for income-generating activities, they may get more income, then
they use this income for consumption. This issue can not be tested by econometric
model. It will be considered this in further research. However, by argument, the
questionnaires contain information on the stated purposes when applying for credit
                                             117




and the main use of this loan. If stated purpose is used, households may misuse the
loan and use it for consumption due to fungibility of credit. However, this research
uses the information on main use and only select the use for production to define
microcredit. Thenceforth, it may be indicated that the impact follows the fourth
mechanism, not direct consumption.

Note: *, ** and ***: Significant at 10%, 5% and 1%, respectively.


       Table 6.6 shows no evidence on the impact of microcredit on accumulation
of durable assets because neither of results from three method are statistically
significant. This indicates that borrowers are not different from non-borrowers in
terms of changes in durable assets. The results are consistent with Takahashi et al.
(2010), Barnes et al. (2001a), but in contrast with Pitt and Khandker (1998).
However, the studies by Barnes et al. (2001a), and Dunn and Arbuckle (2001)
further investigate the impact of microcredit on business assets and find the positive
relationship between them. Therefore, this research also divides durable assets into
two groups, including production and consumer (non-production) durables. The
results show that microcredit has no significant impact on accumulation of non-
production assets and the estimated results are consistent among methods.
Meanwhile, the change in accumulation of production assets is positive and
significant. The result from DID shows that microcredit may increase accumulation
of production assets but this effect is not statistically significant.

CHAPTER 7 – ROLE OF MICROCREDIT IN MITIGATING THE
                       EFFECTS OF HEALTH SHOCKS
       This chapter presents the second objective, namely “Role of Microcredit in
Mitigating the Effects of Health Shocks”, including three sections. The first section
introduces about research methods. The next section describes data used for
analysis. The third section discusses estimated results.


7.1. Research method
7.1.1. Estimation strategy
       To assess the impact of health shocks on income and various types of
consumption, especially the role of credit in coping with the shocks by rural
households, the estimation strategy is based on a research Islam and Maitra (2012).
Research model by Islam and Maitra (2012) applies panel data from three periods
and is written as follows:
  Yivt = 0 + 1HSivt + 2 ( HSivt * CRivt ) + 4 X ivt +  v + t + ( v * t ) +  ivt (Eq.1)

      Where, ∆Yivt denotes the change of dependent variables across survey. HSivt
represents health shocks faced by household. CRivt denote microcredit amount
borrowed by household. Xivt are characteristics of household. δv are dummies of
village fixed effect (VFE). μt is time variable. εivt is error terms. HSivt*CRivt is the
interaction between health shocks variables (HSivt) and microcredit (CRivt). i, v and t
denote household i, village v and time t, respectively.
       Dependent or outcome variables (e.g. income, health expense) are calculated
using the change between t and t-1. Explanatory variables use the data at t.
       Due to data limitation, the model in this research is adjusted and rewritten as
follows (Thanh & Duong, 2017):
          Yiv = 0 + 1HSivt + 2 ( HSivt * CRivt ) + 4 X ivt +  v +  ivt             (Eq.2)
       Similar to Eq. (1), the dependent variables are the change from time t-1 to t
and the explanatory variables uses the information within the survey of time t (that
                                           119




is, survey 2012). Following (Okonogi et al., 2015; Thanh & Duong, 2017), instead
of using simple first difference, this research employs the following function to
measure the change in outcomes:
                                       Yiv 2012 − Yiv 2010
                              Yiv =                                           (Eq.3)
                                                Y
       Where, Yiv is the change in dependent/ outcome variables (e.g. income,
health expense, non-medical expenses, and labor mobility). The details of outcome
variables used for empirical analysis are presented in Section 7.1.2.1. Yiv2012 and
Yiv2010 are the value of the dependent variables in the surveys of 2012 and 2010,
respectively; 𝑌̅ denotes mean of the dependent variable in two surveys
       Under the hypothesis that the impact of health shock on the households with
and without microcredit is different, this paper uses the variable HSivt * CRivt as an
interactive one between the health shock variable and the microcredit amount. The
parameter 1 from equation (2) indicates the average impact of a health shock on
the dependent variables, while controlling for other variables. Meanwhile, the
parameter 2 of the interactive variable between health shock and microcredit
amount indicates the impact of health shock on the dependent variables for the case
of borrowers. In addition, the impact of income shocks at village level such as
agricultural shocks (drought or flood) is controlled by Village Fixed Effects (𝛿𝑣 )
(Ravallion & Chaudhuri, 1997). Islam and Maitra (2012) suggested that VFE can
reduce estimation bias. Without VFE, the estimation may result in bias due to
possible correlation between the omitted or unobserved village characteristics and
the error term. VFE also control for any aggregate risks faced by all households in
the village (Islam & Maitra, 2012).
       As presented in Section 5.1.1, OLS estimates using Eq. (2) may be
endogeneity biased. There are potential heterogeneities that affect both accessibility
to microcredit and outcome (e.g. income, consumption). This research also uses IV
2SLS to control for endogeneity of microcredit. The instruments used for empirical
analysis are presented in Section 7.3.2.
                                        120




7.1.2. Selection of variable
7.1.2.1. Dependent variables
      Based on the literature presented in Section 2.3.4 (Islam & Maitra, 2012;
Okonogi et al., 2015; Mitra et al., 2015), Thanh & Duong, 2017), this research
objective employs income and consumption to reflect the economic outcome of
health shocks. In addition, many studies mention about intra-household labor
mobility when households face with health shock. However, very few studies
investigate the impact of health shocks on intra-household labor mobility.
Moreover, there is no study that examines the role of microcredit in mitigating out-
of-working-age labor mobility when households have health shocks.
      The outcome variables used for analysis are two revenue variables including
earned (EINC) and total revenue (TINC); six consumption expenditure variables
including total (TCON), education (ECON), healthcare (HCON), food (FCON) and
daily non-food (NFCD), other (Annual) and non-food (NFCA); and three labor
variables including children with job (CHILD), elderly with job (OLD), out-of-
working-age member with job (NWW). The detailed definitions of the outcome
variables used for estimation are presented in Panel 1 of Appendix 7.1.

7.1.2.2. Health shocks variables
      As presented in Section 2.3.4, there are various ways to define a health
shock. The general definitions of health shocks are sickness, disease, injury,
disability or death which impede one’s ability to perform normal daily activities
(Alam & Mahal, 2014). In this research, health shock are defined as illness, disease
or injury of household members. For this health shocks, the questionnaires mention
four reasons for a person to visit medical treatment establishment, including: (i)
Vaccination; (ii) Pregnancy checks, insertion of intrauterine devices, abortion, and
birth delivery; (iii) Health checks and consultancy; and (iv) Medical treatment. This
research selects reason 2 and reason 4 to define health shocks because these health
                                              121




problems may result in lower labor productivity or loss in earned income. For
reason (ii), when a woman has pregnancy, then birth delivery or abortion, it
normally leads to their lower productivity and loss of labor days and may also those
of other care-givers in the family. For the reason (iv), traditionally, the rural
residents tend to go to a medical establishment (such as a clinic, a hospital) for
treatment when their health problems have been already serious. Therefore, when
they need to have medical treatment, it causes loss of labor days.


                           Table 7.1 - Types of health shock
Variable Definition                                      Description

         members.
HS1A     Illness/Disease/Injury of any members.          = 1 if affected, 0 otherwise
Note:       Working-Age: 15 to 60 years old


        To investigate the effect of more severe health shocks, this paper only selects
the households with total at least three times of visiting medical establishment by all
members as the households in face of health shocks. Due to the fact that the impact
of this health shock on working-age member and non-workers may be different, this
research investigates the impact of this shock on two different cases, including
health shock of any members and that of working-age members.


7.1.2.3. Microcredit variable
        Microcredit variable used for emprical analysis are loan amount (unit:
million VND). In this research objective, microcredit is defined as a small amount
of money borrowed from preferential credit for the poor sources such as: Vietnam
Bank for Social Policies (VBSP), Employment Support Fund, Poverty Reduction
Fund, political social organizations. As regulated by the Government, the
preferential credits are targeted toward the poor, near-poor, households having just
escaped from poverty, ethnic minority groups, or the disadvantaged groups. These
loans are provided without collateral and their terms range from 1 to 5 years. These
                                               122




loans may be used for investment purposes such as production, self-employment,
and job creation, or consumption (e.g. education, healthcare and housing).
        Table 7.2 presents the number of households with access to microcredit as
well as the average loan size obtained by borrowers. The statitics show that
microcredit is mainly provided by the VBSP, accounting for 90% .
           In the sample, 478 households have access to microcredit in 2010, but the
number reduces to 425 households in 2012. However, the average loan size
increases from 12.5 million VND in 2010 to 16.0 million VND in 2012. Although
average amount of microcredit is quite small, it is important to the rural households,
especially the poor. The ratios of loan size over households’ earned income
(ERatio) are 43.1% in 2010 and 64.9% in 2012, which thereby confirms the
remarkable role of microcredit. In 2010, the interest rate (IRate) is, on average,
0.48%/month in 2010, and it slightly increases up to 0.53%/month in 2012.

7.1.2.4. Other control (explanatory) variables
        In addition to health shock and microcredit variables, some control variables
are also included in the model. Since changes in consumption in response to health
shocks are typically characterized by substantial cross-household heterogeneity,
Islam and Maitra (2012) suggest the inclusion of the set of explanatory variables at
the household level. Hence, based on Islam and Maitra (2012), Okonogi et al.
(2015), and Mitra et al. (2015), the other control variables that may affect welfare
                                          123




include household heads’ characteristics, households’ demographic attributes and
regional dummies. Table 7.3 and Appendix 7.4 presents the descriptive statistics
and definition of the other control variables used for analysis in details.

7.1.3. Research hypotheses
       On the basis of variables used for analysis in Section 7.1.2 and literature
review in Section 2.2.4, the research hypotheses are stated as follows:
       H4a: Health shocks have significant and adverse effects on welfare. In
particular, health shocks significantly reduce income and non-medical expenditures,
while increases medical expenses and non-working-age labors.
       H4b: Microcredit significantly mitigates consequences of health shocks on
welfare. In particular, microcredit significantly insures income and non-medical
expenses, while reduces non-working-age labors.
       Since this research objective focus on two key explanatory variables
including health shocks and microcredit, the other control variables are not
hypothesized here in the interest of brevity.

7.2. Research data
7.2.1. Data source
       This research applies the data from Vietnam Household Living Standard
Survey (VHLSS) 2010 and 2012 conducted by General Statistics Office of Vietnam
(GSO). These datasets provide various information on households’ characteristics,
including demographic attributes, income, consumption, borrowing, health
problems and so forth. The survey is conducted nationwide and designed to
represent the whole population of Vietnam.
       The first three research objectives employ VARHS. It is therefore essential
to enquire whether VARHS and VHLSS are in accordance with each other. It is
noted that VARHS was initially a sub-sample of the households which participated
in the VHLSS, chosen to be provincially representative. According to Brandt and
Tarp (2017), the Vietnam Access to Resources Household Survey (VARHS) is
                                         124




designed with the aim of supplementing the large and nationally representative
Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey (VHLSS). VHLSS and VARHS are
conducted by every two years.
       Appendix 1.2 discusses these datasets in details. Thenceforth, it is indicated
that these datasets can be used interchangeable or combined without problems of
difference in measurement error.


7.2.2. Research sample
       Data from both VHLSS surveys 2010 and 2012 are collected from 9399
households in 3,133 communes/ward in the 7 main socio-economic regions
nationwide. The VHLSS 2010 are mainly conducted between June and December
2010, while VHLSS 2012 are conducted in March and December 2012.
       The survey 2012 re-interviews 4,173 households from the survey 2010, and
thereby, there are 4,173 households surveyed in both waves. The purpose of this
research is to investigate the rural households. Therefore, 3,071 rural households are
kept for analysis. After identifying and dropping out the observations with missing
information, the final sample used for estimation is 3,021 rural households.

7.2.3. Descriptive statistics
       Descriptive statistics of the variables used for estimation is presented in
Table 7.3. From left to right shows the statistical values of mean and standard
deviation of whole sample, non-borrowers and borrowers, respectively.
       The descriptive statistics show that households with ill or injured working-
age members (HS1W) account for 10.39 percent of the whole sample, 9.98 percent
of the non-borrowers and 12.94 percent of the borrowers. For the case of illness or
injury of any members (HS1A), the ratio of households with this health shock are
21.25 percent, 21.15 percent and 21.88 percent for the case of whole sample, non-
borrowers and borrowers, respectively. The descriptive statistics show that the
borrowing households experience more health shock than the non-borrowers.

7.3. Results and discussions
7.3.1. Are health shocks unanticipated?
       Before estimating using Eq. (2), it is necessary to check the validity of
assumption that whether health shocks are unanticipated (Islam & Maitra, 2012);
that is, whether health shocks in the previous period are more likely to affect the
health shocks in the current period. Following Islam and Maitra (2012), the test will
be examined using the following equation:
                 HSivt = 0 + 1HSivt −1 + 3 X ivt +  v +  ivt                 (Eq.4)

        HSivt and HSivt −1 denote a certain type of health shocks at t (survey 2012)

and t-1 (survey 2010), respectively. X ivt are the characteristics at time t.  v are
dummies for village fixed effects (VFE).  ivt is the error term.

       The coefficient of interest is 1 . Eq. (4) will be estimated using Probit. It is
expected that the coefficient 1 will be insignificant; that is, health shocks at t-1 are
unlikely to affect health shocks in at t.
       Table 7.4 shows the estimates on whether HS1A and HS1W are
unanticipated (see Appendix 7.2 for more details). Against expectation, the
coefficients 1 are significant, which may indicate that health shocks at t-1 are
more likely to affect the health shocks in at t. However, by definition, HS1A and
HS1W include pregnancy or injury/sickness/disease of members in family. For the
case of pregnancy, it is unlikely that pregnancy status at t and t-1 will be correlated.
As for injury/sickness/disease, there is lack of information on the specific
injury/sickness/disease. The specific injury/sickness/disease incurred by households
in both periods may be the same or different; therefore, it cannot be fully indicated
that whether these health shocks are persistent or not. Therefore, it may be argued
that the significant results of 1 in Table 7.4 are random rather than anticipated.
Before continuing the estimations using Eq. (2), the assumption that the health
shocks are unanticipated is still held in this research.

7.3.2. First stage results using instrumental variables
        As presented in Section 5.1.1 and 7.1.1, before estimation using Eq. (2), it is
necessary to check for the endogeneity of microcredit. A common method of
treating this endogeneity bias is instrumental variable (IV) approach. Similar to
discussion in Section 5.3, due to unavailability of data, this research can only use
two instruments suggested by Nguyen (2008), including commune poverty rate and
distance from commune to the nearest banks.
        Table 7.5 and 7.6 present the estimates in the first stage using IV 2SLS for
both cases of HS1W and HS1A (see Appendices 7.3 and 7.4 for details). In Model
1 of both cases, the two IVs seem to have significant effect on accessibility to
microcredit. However, the F-test shows that the null hypothesis that the IVs are
week cannot be rejected. Model 2 and Model 3 of both cases analyze using only one
IV, and yield the same results as Model 1. The first stage estimates and F-test show
that the instruments are relevant in this research, thus they cannot be used in the
second stage; therefore, only estimates for the first stage are reported. In summary,
compared to Nguyen (2008), such IVs as commune poverty rate and distance from
commune to the nearest banks are not relevant in this research.

        Due to data limitation, this research cannot use other IVs for empirical
analysis. Thenceforth, in order for Eq. (2) to be valid, this research objects assume
that microcredit is exogenous, that is, it is uncorrelated with the error terms. Further
study with relevant and strong IVs should be conducted to deal with endogeneity.
The estimates in Section 7.3.3 and 7.3.4 use results from OLS using Eq. (2).

        Table 7.7 and 7.8 present the results of the impacts of health shocks on
households’ welfare and the role of microcredit in coping with such shocks using
VFE. The estimated results of other control variables using VFE are presented in
Appendices 7.5 and 7.7. Multicollinearity test is also taken into account when
estimating the results. The main variables are found to have no or less
multicollinearity. Meanwhile, some village dummies are perfectly collinear and
those variables are automatically dropped out of the model by STATA.

7.3.3. Illness/ Disease/ Injury of working-age members (HS1W)
      INCOME. HS1W is found to reduce households’ change in earned revenue
(EINC) by 9.56 percent and total revenue (TINC) by 7.94 percent. This is because
neither labors with health problem can directly work nor the care-givers in the
family. The results show that when households face HS1W, earned revenue is more
severely affected than total revenue. Regarding the role of microcredit, the
coefficients β2 are statistically insignificant, which means microcredit does not
improve revenue of households with HS1W.
      In this case, households may utilize loans for direct consumption (the first
mechanism in conceptual framework) or for mitigating other consequences such as
selling assets or mobilizing out-of-working-age labor (the third mechanism in
conceptual framework). Therefore, the upcoming section will investigate the impact
of HS1 on the change in consumption and intra-household labor mobility.
      CONSUMPTION. HS1W results in higher total consumption (CONS).
Specifically, HS1W increases the change in total consumption by around 11.7
percent. The coefficient β2 is statistically insignificant, which means microcredit
does not improve total consumption.
      The above-presented interpretations may indicate no mitigating role of
microcredit in smoothing consumption when households face HS1W. However, the
up-coming discussion will separate the total consumption into different groups and
investigate the impact of microcredit on each specific type of consumption.
      EDUCATION (ECON). HS1W has no impact on change in education
expenditure. This is reasonable because health and education are the top priority
concerns of any households. The households will not reduce expenditure on
education even if they face health problems. Household with HS1W are found not
to pay more for education when borrowing from microcredit sources.
      HEALTH (HCON). HS1W is found to greatly increase the change in
healthcare expenditures by 34.1 percent. This is reasonable because households
with health problems certainly need to pay more for medical treatments or
                                           131




medicines. This is short-term decision but may have-long term impact because more
healthcare may mean more investment human capital. With healthier and better
physical conditions, household members can improve the family’s economic
conditions in long term. There is no evidence to conclude the role of microcredit in
improving health expense; that is, the coefficient β2 is statistically insignificant.
       FOOD CONSUMPTION (FCON). HS1W has no impact on change in food
consumption. When any working-age members have health problems, if the
expenditure on daily food is cut down, the health problems may become more
serious. Food consumption should even increase because the sick or injured
members need to be provided with more nutrition to recover their physical
functioning abilities. Similar to health expenditure, consumption on food means
investment in human capital. The coefficient β3 is statistically insignificant, which
indicates that microcredit play no role in smoothing food consumption. This is
consistent with findings by Islam and Maitra (2012).
       DAILY NON-FOOD CONSUMPTION (NFCD). HS1W is found to have
significant effect on change in these consumptions. As the statistics of the research
samples, the ratio of daily nonfood consumption over the total consumption, on
average, is very small, accounting for 2.60% in 2010 and 2.62% in 2012. That
means the rural households do not consume much daily non-food goods but still
consume some very necessary items such as petroleum, fuel, soap, detergent, etc.
Therefore, when facing health shocks, there may be no change in this consumption.
The role of microcredit in improving the change in this type of consumption is
unambiguous; that is, the coefficient β3 is statistically significant in model without
VFE, but insignificant in model with VFE.
       OTHER NON-FOOD CONSUMPTION (NFCA): There is no change this
consumption when households face HS1W. It is also found that households do not
use loans to pay for any other non-food consumptions when they have HS1W. This
is reasonable because these consumptions including annual non-food items,
administrative and legal services for daily-life requirements, other important family
                                         132




events, durable goods, domestic or oversea holidays expenditure on house,
electricity, water, etc. These consumptions normally include items for their basic
needs, goods or services that the rural resident hardly or never uses and some
required by the authorities. Therefore, the rural households tend or unable to change
this consumption even they face health shocks. Microcredit also has no effect on the
change in this consumption when households face HS1W.
       MOBILITY OF NON-WORKING-AGE MEMBER. Estimates indicate that
when households face HS1W, they may mobilize the idle out-of-working-age
members for intra-household labor substitution. Especially, when working labors
face health shocks, the elderly persons in the family are used as substitution. The
coefficients β1 show that households do not mobilize children but elderly to cope
with the temporary loss in working-age laborers. It can be explained that in the rural
area, some food consumptions can be self-sufficient such as rice, vegetable, or
raising home livestock and so forth. Therefore, when the working-age members
have health problems, the households will take advantage of out-of-working-age
laborers. However, with access to microcredit, households with HS1W can inhibit
the use of out-of-working-age laborers. The coefficient β2 in NWW regression has
negative and statistically significance at 5 percent level indicating that when
working-age labors face health shocks, accessibility to microcredit can ease, to
some extent, the temporary employment of non-working-age (child and elderly)
persons as substitution. The coefficients β2 for the case of CHILD and OLD are
negative but insignificant, and thereby there is no evidence to conclude the role of
microcredit for each specific case.
       The total effect of health shock which is the sum of ˆ1 + ˆ2 * CR depends
on the amount of microcredit received. Without access to microcredit, the impact of
health shocks is given by ˆ1 ; meanwhile, the total effect equals to ˆ1 + ˆ2 if the
rural households borrow from any microcredit sources. For instance, HS1W
significantly increases mobility of out-of-working-age labor by 8.98 percent when
households can not access any microcredit sources. When households can borrow
                                           133




(with average amount of microcredit is 16 million VND), the effect of HS1W is
0.0898−0.0075*16 =−0.0302 (3.02 percent), and this total effect is statistically

significant due to the rejection of the joint test ˆ1 + ˆ2 = 0 . Therefore, it indicates
that households with access to microcredit do not need to mobilize out-of-working-
age labor after an onset of illness/injury on working-age members. The other
estimates can be interpreted in the similar way.



7.3.4. Illness/ Disease/ Injury of any members (HS1A)
       INCOME. HS1A has no significant effect on any types of income. It can be
explained that HS1A may not be induced by working-age members, so this health
shock does not affect household’s earned income. Microcredit is found to play no
role in improving income of households with HS1A.
       CONSUMPTION. Similar to HS1W, HS1A has no significant effect on
expenditure for education (ECON), food consumption (FCON), and all types of
non-food consumption (NFCD and NFCA). Meanwhile, HS1A is also found to
increase the change in health expenditure (HCON). Specifically, HS1A leads to an
increase in health expenditure by 35.5 percent. Also, there is no impacts of HS1A
on total consumption and education expenditure. Regarding the impact of
microcredit, the estimates indicate that households with HS1A use microcredit to
smooth total consumption, health care and two types of non-food consumption.
       TOTAL CONSUMPION (NFCD). As above discussion, HS1A does not
change total consumption, but when households with HS1A borrow from
microcredit sources, their total consumption increases by 0.775 percent with
additional 1 million VND borrowed.
       HEALTH EXPENDITURE (HCON). The role of microcredit in explaining
the change in health expenditure after an onset of HS1A is unambiguous. The
coefficient β2 is positive but significant in only model without VFE.
                                                     134




        DAILY NON-FOOD CONSUMPION (NFCD). With access to microcredit,
the households with HS1A pay more to daily non-food consumption but the
increasing level is very small. Specifically, with additional 1 million VND
borrowed, on average, the households will increase their change in daily non-food
consumption by around 1 percent.
         ANNUAL NON-FOOD CONSUMPION (NFCA). When households in face
of HS1A use microcredit to pay more for other non-food consumption but the
change is very small. Specifically, with additional 1 million VND borrowed, they
will increase this consumption by around 1%. The explanation is that they may use
their loan to pay for items that improve their health status, for instance clean water.
         Another plausible explanation is that the rural households with an onset of
three health problems may consider this as bad luck to their family, thereby
spending more on regular worship activities. Particularly, ethnic minority people
and low educational people in rural areas often go to temples or conduct religious
worship activities in their houses. Such activities are considerably costly3. Banerjee
and Duflo (2012) mention some kinds of similar consumptions, for instance, pay for
wizard to cure disease in developing countries. Therefore, households with health
shocks may utilize their loan to pay for the items associated with worship activities.
         MOBILITY OF NON-WORKING-AGE MEMBER. HS1A has no
significant effect on intra-household labor mobility. Households with HS1A appear
to reduce child labor uses when they have access to microcredit. Specifically, with
additional 1 million borrowed, households with HS1A reduces the child labor by
0.448 percent. It means that even in the case of facing health problems in their
family, children can still keep going to schools and thus, the long-term investment
of the household in human capital is not threatened. There is no evidence for the
role of microcredit in response to HS1A for the case of elderly laborers and non-
working-age labors in general.

thousands USD.

                      CHAPTER 8 – CONCLUSIONS
       This chapter will summarize the findings from four research objectives.
Thenceforth, some policies will be implied to improve the effectiveness of
microcredit programs. Limitations and further research are also discussed. This
chapter will organize and present summaries, policy implications, limitation and
further studies by research objectives.


8.1. Objective 1: Determinants of accessibility o microcredit
8.1.1. Summary
       The research model employs logistic regression with panel data using RE,
FE and Pooled OLS moedels. The model includes characteristics at household head,
household and commune levels. In addition, sample is also divided into poor and
non-poor samples for further investigation. Main findings are as follows:
      • Age. For all the cases (whole, poor and non-poor samples), older
         households head tend to be less likely to access microcredit.
      • Alternative Cash Sources. Saving and non-microcredit have negative
         effects on accessibility to microcredit. For the poor and non-poor samples,
         the results are quite similar to whole sample, except for insignificant effect
         of saving for case of the poor.
      • Labor. Households with greater size are more likely to access microcredit
         sources. In contrast, households with more dependency ratio would be
         less likely to access microcredit. The results for the poor and non-poor
         samples are the same with those of whole sample.
      • Social Capital. For all the cases (whole, poor and non-poor sample),
         number of organizations that households participate, a proxy for social
         capital and network, have positive effect on accessibility to microcredit.
      • Poverty status. For the whole sample, such variables as poverty status and
         national target program commune are positively associated with
         accessibility to microcredit. For the poor and non-poor samples,
                                         136




         households residing in national target program communes are also found
         to have higher accessibility to microcredit.
      • Distance. Distance to main road is positively associated with accessibility
         to microcredit. The coefficient of this factor is positive for all the cases;
         however, it is only significant for the case of non-poor samples.
      • Land.     Agricultural   land    significantly     increases   accessibility   to
         microcredit. This factor is significant for the whole and non-poor samples
         while it is insignificant for the poor samples.
      • Based on in-depth interview, ethnic minority or less educated households
         report that loan procedure is quite complicated, which prevent them from
         obtaining the loan.
      • In-depth interview with credit group leaders and credit officers find other
         factors that may affect households’ accessibility to credit, including: (1)
         households’ production or business plan; (2) their credit history; and (3)
         their seriousness and devotion to work/life.


8.1.2. Policy implications
      Appendix 8.1 show that among microcredit borrowers, non-poor households
still account for a higher proportion. Therefore, some policies should be
implemented to increase the poor households’ access to microcredit. As above-
mentioned, accessibility to credit include two steps. At the first steps, households
with demand for credit will apply to borrow. At the second step, credit providers
will decide whether households are granted with the loan. Therefore, policy
implication should focus not only supply side but also demand side.
      Targeting the poor households and poor communes. Microcredit needs to
target the poor households and households in communes of national targeting
programs. The poor or disadvantaged households are more likely to borrow, but
many of them are still unable to access credit sources (see Appendix 8.1). Poor
households typically reside in remote or disadvantaged locations which may be
                                         137




difficult to access, thus they and lenders often incur high transation costs such as
transportation, communication (for both), or monitoring cost (for lenders).
Therefore, it reduces their accessibility to microcredit. Supporting programs should
be applied to assist these households with the transaction cost problems.
       Narrowing gap between the banks and the poor. As shown in Appendix
8.1, poor households or households in poor communes are more likely to access
microcredit, but the ratio of the poor and households in poor communes
participating in microcredit programs are still low. The reason may be from the
rural households themselves (demand side). These households are normally cash-
constrained and have high demand for cash. However, these households are
normally very risk averse and less self-confident, thereby they do not apply for
borrowing. Therefore, banking system in the rural areas should be developed to
make the banks closer and more friendly to the poor, which thereby enhances their
accessibility to microcredit programs.
       Simplifying loan procedure. The results show that a large proportion of
households still borrow from informal sectors. Loan procedure should be simplified.
Since the education level of the poor is low, the complicated procedure will be a big
hindrance to the poor people because they may have difficulties in understanding
and completing loan procedures. Moreover, the complicated procedure may cause
the adverse selection in granting credit or lead to higher transaction cost. From
qualitative analysis presented in Section 4.3, it is suggested that it is essential to
simplify the loan procedure should be simplified to enhance the poor’s accessibility
to microcredit program (Ho & Duc, 2015).
       Integration of formal and informal credit sector. The research finds that
formal and informal credit sector co-exists in Vietnam’ rural financial market. The
co-exist of both sectors seems to be inevitable (Khoi et al., 2013). Policymakers in
Vietnam should take into consideration the role of informal sectors in rural financial
market. The operation of informal sector should be developed and regulated, linked
or integrated with formal sector rather than eliminated (Li et al., 2011a; Khoi et al.,
                                         138




2013). Good linkages would enable one sector to take advantages of strength and
overcome weakness of the other sector. For instance, formal sector will take
advantage of the outreach and local knowledge of informal sector, thereby reducing
the cost of monitoring or establishing branches/network/staff at local region;
meanwhile, informal sectors can benefit from formal sectors in terms of ability to
mobilize resources and access to wide networks across the region. Consequently,
the cooperation between the formal and informal sectors can helps improve the
efficiency and outreach of microcredit in particular and rural financial services in
general. In other words, integrating these two sectors into a well-functioning rural
credit market can improve rural households’ accessibility to credit, and especially
the poor can have more opportunities to access borrowings.
       Supplementary programs. The improvement of accessibility to microcredit
may be initiated by the households themselves through their active participation in
credit groups and improvements of their education, knowledge and skills.
Thenceforth, these can help households establish their business and/or production
plan, creditworthiness and capacity of repayment.


8.1.3. Limitations and further studies
       The information on whether households are cash-constrained or demand for
credit is unavailable in the VARHS. The analysis is conducted based on an
assumption that all rural households have demand for cash. Therefore, the estimates
may be biased. Based on this assumption, borrowers are households that have
demand for credit, then apply to borrow and are granted with credit. Non-borrowers
include 1) households that demand for credit, then apply to borrow but are not
granted, and 2) households that do not demand for credit or do not apply to borrow.
However, this assumption is likely true in rural Vietnam, especially the poor.
       The model includes non-microcredit as an explanatory variable for
accessibility to microcredit. Accessibility to microcerdit and non-microcredit may
be jointly determined at the same time. Therefore, the estimates may be biased due
                                          139




to potential endogeneity. In addition, this study selects relevant variables to include
in the model to control for the endogeneity from such variables as non-microcredit,
saving, or poverty. However, this approach is only derived from literature and may
not fully control for potential endogeneity. Further study with advanced techniques
should be conducted to fully treat endogeneity.


8.2. Objective 2: Microcredit and adoption of improved varieties
8.1.1. Summary
       To investigate role of microcredit in fostering farmers’ decisions on adoption
of modern varieties in two stages, this research applies the Tobit and Double-Hurdle
(two-step) models. The results show that the double-hurdle is more superior to the
Tobit model in investigating the farmers’ behaviors toward adopting modern rice
varieties. That is, the farmers’ decisions on probability of adoption and adoption
level (measured by expenditure on purchasing modern varieties) are determined
separately. Some main findings include:
   • Microcredit has no impact on farmer’s decisions on whether to adopt (first
       stage) and how much to purchase improved varieties (second stage).
   • Many other factors that affect farmers’ decision at the first stage (e.g. non-
       microcredit, production assets, durable assets, irrigated land, cultivation land,
       non-farm, location, extension visit, information/ assistance, ethnicity,
       agricultural labor, permanent market, and some regional dummies) and at the
       second stage (e.g. irrigated land, marital status, working-age member,
       organization, national target program, permanent market, agricultural
       development program, and some regional dummies).
   • The estimates for the poor and non-poor samples also indicate no the role of
       microcredit in explaining farmers’ decision on adoption of improved
       varieties. Some plausible explanations are that 1) adoption of new varieties is
       rather risky while the farmers tend to be risk-averse; 2) new agricultural
                                           140




       inputs require new cultivation practice; 3) agricultural production, especially
       rice production, takes more time to get return than non-farm activities.
   • Further investigations reveal that microcredit plays a significant role in
       fostering farmers’ decision on non-farm business and livestock. Meanwhile,
       similar to the case of adoption of improved varieties, microcredit has no
       significant impact on other crop production.


8.2.2. Policy implications
       Microcredit is considered as a cash source that may relax farmer’s cash-
constraint, thenceforth they can invest in income generating activities. However,
Nashihin (2014) state that the microcredit is not a magic bullet and it needs some
necessary conditions in which it works. The microcredit may not work in every case
or for every borrower. Therefore, in addition to microcredit, some other aspects
related to rice production should be implemented and/or improved:
       Infrastructure. Agricultural production, especially cultivation, is risky in
terms of natural disaster and output market while the farmers tend to be risk-averse.
Therefore, in addition to credit, the Government should improve infrastructure to
prevent or mitigate the effect of natural disasters on rice production. Irrigated land
is found to have significantly positive effect of adopting decisions at both stages.
Following the explanation by Fernandez-Cornejo et al. (1994), irrigation and
modern varieties may be considered as complementary technologies, and irrigation
may improve yields. However, investment in irrigation system is costly. Therefore,
with small amount of microcredit, farmers may not choose to invest in new
varieties. The improvement of irrigation system should be invested by the
Government. Moreover, Appendix 8.2 confirms the importance of infrastructure
because around 7.1 percent of rice farmers state that “Poor transport infrastructure”
is one of the difficulties in getting access to agricultural inputs.
       Output market. Many farmers may have problems with finding buyers for
new varieties with a reasonable price. The risk related to output markets may inhibit
                                         141




adopting decision of farmers. Hence, they may not use microcredit to invest in this
new input. The output market should be insured to benefit the rice farmers.
       Information and Support. Extension visit and information or support are
found to play significant role in fostering farmer’s decision toward adoption of
improved rice varieties. Farmers should also be supported pre, during and post
cultivation of improved varieties. It is suggested that the effectiveness of
agricultural extension centers and farmer union should be improved. These
organizations need to provide farmers with sufficient information about new
improved varieties, input and output markets and implement training activities in
how cultivate improved rice varieties. Moreover, Appendix 8.2 show that around
29.1 percent of farmers encounter at least one difficulty in getting access to the
agricultural inputs. In addition to difficulties related to cash constraints such as
“Prices too high”, “Not enough access to credit”, or “Not able to buy on credit”,
these difficulties include “Not enough information”. Thenceforth, Appendix 8.2
may confirm the importance of agricultural extension center and farmers unions in
providing farmers with information and supports.
       Agricultural development programs (ADP). ADP is found to have positive
and significant effect on adoption of improved rice varieties. These programs may
provide farmers with information on inputs and outputs, training activities or
technical support in agricultural productions, including rice production. Hence,
ADP may help farmers how to take best advantages of credit and do production
effectively, thereby increasing their decision toward adoption of new varieties. It is
necessary that ADP should be expanded and their effectiveness should be improved.

8.2.3. Limitations and further studies
       Due to the unavailability of data, the model does not include the
characteristics or farmers’ perception on the varieties and price of varieties, which
are considered as important factors.
                                            142




       In this research, adopters of improved rice varieties are defined as “farmers
who use one of such varieties as local improved seed, hybrid seed from Vietnam
and hybrid seed from China. Each variety may have different characteristics.
However, due to lack of detailed information on specific varieties, further
investigation into adoption of each types can not be conducted.
       The research uses cross-sectional data; therefore, it does not capture the
change in behaviors of farmers (cross-sectional units) over time. Further study will
investigate this issue using panel data.
       This study uses three instrumental variables to treat endogeneity bias due to
microcredit, but these IVs may be not strong enough. Due to data limitation, this
research cannot examine other IVs. Further study with self-designed questionnaire
should be conducted to collect other sufficient IVs to treat endogeneity.


8.3. Objective 3: Impact evaluation of microcredit on welfare
8.3.1. Summary
       This research evaluates the impact of microcredit on households’ welfare
using Match Difference in Difference (PSM-DID) method. The research employs
various welfare indicators such as income and total output value from different
sources, food consumption, and accumulation of assets. Main findings include:
   • Total output value. Microcredit increases output value from total earned
       sources and self-employment, and reduce output value from common
       property resources, but has no effect on output value of other sources,
       including agriculture and its sub-sectors (crop and livestock) and wage.
   • Income. Microcredit improves self-employment income, and reduce income
       from crop production, but has no effect on income from other sources,
       including agriculture, livestock, wage and common property resources.
   • Food consumption. Microcredit increases expenditure for food consumption,
       especially industrial (non-agricultural) food, but no significant effect on
       expenditure for agricultural food.
                                         143




   • Assets. Microcredit has no significant effect on accumulation of value of all
      assets. However, further investingation shows that microcredit significantly
      increases the accumulation of production assets.


8.3.2. Policy implications
       In order to improve the effectiveness of microcredit, it is necessary to
combine microcredit with other activities and programs. They include:
       Training. Without knowledge and skills, the rural households may not take
best advantage of microcredit; that is, they would not know how to do production or
run business effectively (Ho & Duc, 2015), and thereby microcredit may result in
negligible or even no outcomes. Therefore, in addition to credit, the rural
households need to be equipped with knowledge in investment in farm/ non-farm
activities. Thenceforth, training activities in entrepreneurial skills or agricultural
productions should be implemented (Khoi et al., 2013). To achieve this, the role of
agricultural extension centers and other mass organizations should be promoted.
       Infrastructure. Rural households normally face agricultural shocks (e.g.
disasters). This may somewhat explain why microcredit has no effect on
agricultural activities. Therefore, good infrastructure can secure agricultural
production activities, and thereby they can take advantage of their investment. In
addition, such infrastructures as road, electricity or internet should be improved to
enhance households’ access to input and output market.
       Supporting microcredit. Since the results find some positive effects of
microcredit, it indicates the significant role of microcredit in improving the welfare
of rural households. Therefore. the Government should have policies to facilitate the
microcredit programs in rural areas. The Government should establish a better legal
framework or incentives (i.e. tax, operation premise, establishment procedure) so
that other commercial banks or NGOs can have entry and do business in rural credit
market (Ho & Ut, 2009). Infrastructure should be invested in and incentive
programs should be established to attract more investment into rural areas,
                                           144




especially the remote area or area of nation targeted programs (Khoi et al., 2013).
Thenceforth, the quantity and quality of microcredit can be improved; that is, more
households can have access to microcredit and/ or borrow higher amount.


8.3.3. Limitations and further studies
       In this research, control group are defined as non-borrowers at follow-up.
Some of them are found to borrow at baseline, but drop out at follow-up. Therefore,
the estimated results on the impact of microcredit may be biased. Though, this issue
is controlled in the model, the bias may still persist.
       This research only examines impact of microcredit on food consumption. It
is possible that microcredit significantly affect other outcomes such as access to
health care, educational attainment, clean water or modern sanitary systems, other
daily non-food consumption, etc. However, due to availability of data, such impacts
have not been addressed in this research.
       This research only focuses on microcredit as defined in Section 4.1.2.1. It
would be interesting to investigate the difference in impact of microcredit by banks
and institutions, informal sectors, the impact of “big” loan, purpose and main use
such as microcredit for consumption and production, different types of income-
generating activities. For instance, impact of microcredit provided by each
institution may be different because the financial services and the extra services
may vary among the providers. Similar, this research has not pointed out whether
the microcredit is more important than other credit. These issues need to be further
examined to make comparison.
       Moreover, the mission of microcredit programs is to help the poor improve
living standard and escape poverty. The latter has not been examined in this
research. A further study should be also extended to address this issue.
       Households’ welfare is likely to be affected by family shocks, or agricultural
shocks. However, influence of such shocks is neglected in this research. This may
                                         145




reduce the accuracy of impact evaluation of microcredit on households’ welfare.
This issue should be taken into account in a further research.


8.4. Objective 4: Role of microcredit in mitigating the effects of health shocks
8.4.1. Summary
       This objective investigates the impacts of health shocks and the mitigating
role of microcredit using VFE regression. The findings are mixed, depending upon
the specific shock and outcomes of interest. The main findings are as follows:
   • Revenue. Health shocks have significant impact on households’ revenue, but
      the results vary depending on types of health shock and revenue. Households
      in face of HS1W or HS1A have lower earned revenue, while only HS1W
      decreases total revenue. Microcredit is found to have no effect on earned and
      total revenue of households with any health shocks.
   • Consumption. Households with HS1W and HS1A have higher change in
      total consumption and health care expense. There is no evidence to conclude
      the effect of any health shocks on the change in such expenditures as
      education, food consumption and non-food consumption. Microcredit is also
      found to have no effect on smoothing consumption of households with HS1A
      but significantly increase the change in total consumption and non-food
      consumption of households with HS1A. The results also find the positive
      effect of microcredit on the change in health expense of households with
      HS1A and the change in daily-non-food consumption of households with
      HS1W, but these effects are unambiguous (that is, only significant in model
      without VFE). In summary, when households face any health shocks, they
      may use microcredit for healthcare or daily non-food.
   • Intra-household labor mobility. When facing HS1W, households tend to
      mobilize non-working-age members to work, especially the elderly.
      Meanwhile, HS1A has no effect on intra-household labor mobility.
                                          146




       Microcredit is found to mitigate the adverse impact of HSW1 on mobility of
       non-working-age members.
   • In summary, the findings confirm the role of microcredit in mitigating some
       consequences of health shocks. Microcredit is found to reduce the mobility
       of non-working-age members, but its impacts on income and consumption
       are negligible and depend upon a case specific. Generally speaking,
       microcredit appears to mitigate the adverse effects of health shocks in both
       short run (direct consumption) and long-run (reducing labor substitution).


8.4.2. Policy implications
       The rural households may misuse the loan, especially when they are in an
onset of income shocks but lack of coping strategies. In order to help the rural
households take best advantage of microcredit, they should be provided with more
supporting with basic needs, such as official health care, education, decent
employment and small grants.


8.4.3. Limitations and further studies
       The impact of health shocks as well as the role of microcredit may be
different depending on the economic condition of households. When facing health
shocks, households may use some informal strategies such as assets sales, livestock
sales, informal loan, private and public transfer, etc. A further research should be
focused on the role of microcredit in mitigating the sales of assets or livestock.
       In this research, microcredit and health shocks used for analysis are only
observed at one period, therefore it does not capture the change of these
characteristics over time that may affect the outcomes. Further study should be
expanded using panel data to capture these effects.
       To treat endogeneity due to microcredit, two potential IVs are examined in
this research objective, but they are found to be irrelevant. Further study with
relevant and sufficient IVs should be conducted to deal with endogeneity.

                                 APPENDIX 1.2
                    Comparison between VARHS and VHLSS

       Many households surveyed in the VARHS over the years are also
interviewed in the VHLSS. The interviewees in VARHS, therefore, are the rural
households extracted from the large-scale VHLSS database. VARHS focuses on
information related rural households’ access to land, labor and credit markets. The
VHLSS has been implemented since 1992 with support from the World Bank and
others, and VARHS since 2006. While VARHS follows households over time,
VHLSS generates nationally representative data in each cross-section.
       VARHS supplements and extends the VHLSS.
   •   Supplements: VARHS is a repeated survey of the same households (a unique
       panel dataset). In other words, the same households are surveyed in each
       round and then it provides repeated data points about these households over
       time. Meanwhile, VHLSS does not track a large number of households
       across multiple survey rounds.
   •   Extends: VARHS asks in detail questions about land, agriculture, income,
       expenditure, assets, investments, market linkages, and much more…
       The sample of VARHS resembles, to a large extent, the sample of VHLSS
datasets. VARHS is aimed at supplementing the information in the nationally
representative VHLSS. VARHS is not nationally representative survey. Instead, the
purpose of VARHS was to start developing a unique panel of households. VHLSS
has instead relied on a rotating panel of households. Therefore, the VARHS and
VHLSS are best understood as complementary sources of information. Each
database has advantages and limitations.
       VHLSS is primarily aimed to measure consumption and other living standard
indicators, whereas the main objective of VARHS to collect information on land,
credit, and labor over time.
       Overall, the VARHS database has been very successful in tracking the same
households in each survey, leaving analysts or researchers with a unique panel
                                      174




dataset. VARHS households are—except for age—quite similar to households in
the VHLSS. Comparison of VARHS with VHLSS shows that Small differences
exist for such variables as gender, Kinh ethnicity, illiteracy, and age (Brandt &
Tarp, 2017).
